077,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I totally agree with the opinion that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons as follows. Smoking is a normal phenomenon in the social nowadays. Everyone knows its negative effects, but some men even women can't get rid of it. You will always see someone smoking in the public, because their cravings of tobacco break out and it is too hard to bear it. But both you and I know that if someone around us smokes, we are all affected by the second-hand smoking, especially babies. This behavior can also pollute the atmosphere and do harm to all the people who are served in the restaurant. Restaurants are places for people to eat and enjoy themselves. If people smoke there, those non-smokers will have to bear the terrible smell. The second-hand smoking of course will influence their health. Thus, in my option, we should ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country to prevent ourselves from the negative effects of smoking. And it is the government's duty to do something from now on to make the ban possible. Of course, we all should follow the rule and then we can enjoy safe meals in the all the restaurants in the near future."
211,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Personally, I totally agree with this statement. And I have two points here to support my opinion. Firstly, smoking in public places, such as restaurants, is really harmful to the public health. It is widely acknowledged that the second-hand smoking could do significant harm to the people around you. What's more, being a decent person in this developing society requires every individual to take the responsibility to the whole community in every occasion. Therefore, banning smoking at all the restaurant is necessary and it can contribute to both the public health and showing our respect to others. Secondly, banning smoking at restaurants can help to achieve a graceful environment for enjoying a tasty meal and communication. Apparently, in some cases, people go to restaurants for communication rather than food alone. And the stingy smell, such as smoke, can definitely disturb the atmosphere of talking. Anyway, banning smoking at all the restaurant does not indicate that it is inhuman or inconsiderate, having noticed in some restaurants that they provided the customers a rest room to handle their personal need for release themselves. Based on those two points I have stressed, I'm in favor of the policy: Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China."
145,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, having a part-time job has increasingly grown in popularity in the last few yeas. It has a meaningful and positive impact on the community you serve. In the meanwhile, it can have many benefits you, too. As soon as I am concerned, there are two reasons to have a part-time job, improve the work experience, reduce the family burden. On the one hand, when you are in part-time job, you will encounter many difficulties, of course, you have to find ways to solve these difficulties. So, over time, when you encounter setbacks, you will face them calmly. This way, when you enter the community, you will face with your work more easily. In today's competitive society, you will have more opportunities to succeed. Therefore, we must participate in part-time actively, it gives us a lot of benefits. On the other hand, our parents provide money for us during our study. However, our parents are hard to make money. We have grown, and I believe we have the ability to earn some money. Thus, the burden of the parents will be reduced. This is also a way to honor our parents. Apart from the two benefits of improving our experience and reducing our parents' burden, there are many other benefits you will find during your part-time job. So it is the time for us all to participate in the part-time job."
322,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In my point of view, part-time job is a necessity for college students. It is estimated that 30% of the college students have done a part-time job. It will bring us quite a few benefits. First of all, earning money is the primary aim of most people. It can release the financial burden of our parents and even make our college life more comfortable. Secondly, the experience it gives us is quite valuable and precious. Once you have experienced the bitterness that few people have, you would have more understandings of life, study, and what we want to achieve. Surly we will be strong enough to face the challenges. We all know that one day we will inevitably step into society and find a suitable job for ourselves. But, how to cooperate with the colleagues? How to work better? How to get along well with the employer? There are many rules and principles that we can't get in class. And if we learn them now, we will have advantages. Of course, we had better look for a part-time job in spare time, but only on condition that we have managed our courses. The grade should be our top concern. In a word, there are a lot of benefits of doing a part-time job, and we are supposed to arrange learning and doing jobs correctly."
144,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. You have a part-time job when you are in college that means you make money by yourself. I think it is a piece of good news for your parents because this way may reduce their pressure. If someone has a job, I think he or she must endeavor to accomplish it. During this process, you will know how difficult your parents make money and you may cherish the money they give you and not waste them. When you do a part-time job, you may meet people who you are not familiar or even do not know, then you will communicate with them and make them understand you. Shortly after, you will find you are good at talking with others, which means you have the ability of communication. By doing a part-time job, you will achieve many qualities. For example, you have to finish a lot of things by yourself and your ability of doing things may improve. What's more, some jobs need you think about many ideas, so your mind also works, your thought is exercised. In addition, you will face different people and different situations, you need overcome all of them, so you should change your ways of solving problems because different conditions have different methods to deal with. Some people may say college students have a part-time job will influence their study, but I want to say that if you find a balance between study and doing a job, you will realize you have a opportunity to adapt to the society after you graduate from the university."
318,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I do agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Let's discuss the restaurant first. So what dose restaurant mean? A restaurant means some place where you have a meal. After a lot of tiring work, you must be tired and hungry. You enter a restaurant and you feel better. You take a seat and figure out what you are going to eat, full of happy minds. However, God plays a joke. A big man with a rude face, sitting next to you, smokes as if there is only himself in the restaurant. Unfortunately, the sick dirty cloud drives towards to you. I promise you will get bad emotions back as soon as you sniff it and you will never want to meet the big man again unless you are this kind of impolite people. If smoking can just disturb your minds without other harmful effect, we needn't take pains to ban it. What's worse, smoking is consuming your life. You can google smoking & bad effect and there is no doubt that you will receive millions of results that tells you the deadly effect of smoking. The main cause is lung cancer. When you smoke, the smoke which contains thousands of harmful things goes into your lung and destroys your body from lung to every place in your body. Just imagine that your cells, your tissues and even your heart are damaged by cigarettes you happily smoke. You are killing yourself! It is much worse that you are murdering others through your pleasant cigarettes. Due to those reasons, we can easily conclude that banning smoking is necessary. We all should say no to cigarettes to save ourselves and people around us."
096,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿When I was young, I was told by my teacher that for a student, it's more important to learn study-ability than learning knowledge. However, my teacher never pointed out the way of learning study-ability, he only teach us how to win the knowledge competition as other teachers, even he knew the importance of the study-ability. I think Chinese students were just like eggs lived in a tremendous protection system before they stepped into university. College students were better, they were more independent, analytical and original, but still were newborn chicken with a piece eggshell. This was a result of many factors, but that's not my focal point, I wanted to focus on how to help college students get rid of the last eggshell. Actually, the answer always was not unique, hundreds people had thousands ways to make them more mature. For most college students, having a part time job was a wise and effective way to get rid of the last eggshell, to make up the defect of growing up by the over protection system. Having a part time job gave you incentive of working hard because you earned from it ; Having a part time job enriched your college life ; Having a part time job made you more sociable and learned more life experience from it...... Actually I can list a lot of benefits of having a part time job for a college student. But we should notice clearly that the central theme was not how much money you earned, how many friends you made, was the ability you learned from the part-time job, was the ability of studying, was the ability of independence, that's the most important!"
262,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ From my viewpoint, this topic is quite reasonable. As a college student, it is important for he or she to learn the knowledge and skills which usually taught in the society. Though our university provides some access to take part in various activities, making us get to know something different in everyday learning, it is proved to be far from enough. For example, we often hear the news like that lots of graduates cannot find the proper job because of lacking experience or having a wrong attitude towards work. Suppose a graduate had taken a part-time job before, he or she will be much more competitive definitely. Secondly, once a college student takes a part-time job, it often forces he or she to be more independent. In this era, students depend a lot on their parents. However, colleges are usually regarded as proper places to improve the ability of independence, in that way, a part-time job may help a student to be independent in finance. I have to acknowledge a problem doubt by many people that taking a part-time will hog a lot of time used for studying, however, as a college student, I can responsibility say that one student in the college absolutely can spare enough time for working. In a word, taking a part-job in college will greatly help a student in many aspects."
351,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There is no doubt that smoking is harmful. It not only does harms to the smokers but also to the people around. Smoking in public is regarded as an impolite behavior. And banning smoking in all the restaurants in the country should be agreed. Restaurants should provide customers a comfortable place to eating. And it is obvious that nonsmokers won't feel at ease when there is a person dragging away. Smoking in the restaurants not only does harms to nonsmokers' health, but also affects their emotions when eating. So it is reasonable to banning smoking in all the restaurants. The ban will make smokers feel unease when eating in the restaurants. This, however, will benefit smokers a lot. They think it to be inconvenient if they smoke, and then they have to think about quit smoking. My father smokes, he has been hooked by over 30 years. He never thought about quit smoking and excused that it is too hard for him to quit smoking. However, he gradually found that it is more and more inconvenient if he smokes because there are more and more NOSMOKING signs in public places. And now, he has to try to quit smoking. Although banning smoking in all the restaurants in the country seems to be very strict for smokers, it benefits both smokers and nonsmokers."
048,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I'm totally agree with this statement. I'm a non-smoker. In my opinion, I think smoking in the restaurant should be banned. Firstly, smoking in public does harm to the whole world. It is known to all that smoking causes lots of problems. For example, many diseases, fire disasters and so on. In recent years, the death-rate of lung cancer and heart disease are getting higher and higher. Then, restaurants are public place; each customer has the right to enjoy their time. However, smokers' smoke will pollute the clean air and let other people breathe in harmful gases. So everyone in public should be aware of other people's feelings, don't let your actions cause harm to others. In the end, I would like to say that many countries have taken similar measures, and have gotten well consequent. Now, in our country, more and more people come to realize the risk that second hand smokers will face, so our government should pay attention to this serious situation, in the meantime, take effective measures to solve this problem. This not only protects the residents' personal rights, but also builds a harmonious social atmosphere. It is good for every side. Generally speaking, I am strongly support this idea, and hope it can come true."
286,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In my view, part-time job is necessary for college students. As we all know, in western countries, many young people who are 18 years old leave their home to live on their own. While they are studying in college, they make a living by doing part-time jobs. The results are that these people are very independent and it is easier for them to make something of themselves in their lives. In China, many college students have realized this and they can make some money. Though it may not be enough to cover their living expense, it can alleviate their parents' burden which is very important. As for themselves, from part-time jobs, they can gain much working experience which may be useful in their future jobs. For example, they can learn to deal with other workmates and get along well with them. If he can make some faithful friends, it is good for his future. From part-time job, he may know about the hardship of working. Thus on one hand, he may have a strong will to study well and find a good job in the future. On the other hand, when he leave university to devote himself to his work, he may find it is easier for him to adjust to the hard work. In one word, part-time job is necessary for college students and we can learn a lot from it which may be very useful for our future."
073,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Many people regard that college students should do some part time job because college students should come into contact with society. But I oppose college student only do some part time job but not do their theoretical knowledge well. Many students don't want to do their college homework, so the part-time job became the best excuse of tier lazy. But in other hands, college student have taken 12 years education in primary school and middle school and they have no chance to come into contact with society. so there are in inseparable connection between in social practice and heir college theoretical knowledge, we can't only do our social practice like part-time job but to do our theoretical knowledge, just like a primary school student can't do part time job. In the opposite side, if we only do our theoretical knowledge, we can't develop our social ability. It will become a serious problem of that we can't find a suitable job. But it's obvious that college theoretical knowledge is more important than having a part time job. Generally speaking, in our college, we should do our college theoretical knowledge well firstly. After that, if we have more time and energy, we can do some part time job for earning some money, accumulating social experience and so on. But if have some problem in our college study like studying or students' union, we should do our schoolwork first."
215,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As a matter of fact, I'm just doing a part time job as a fraulein now at weekends. I also get some money from it and feel very happy, because it is the first money I got by myself. As a fraulein, I must face with many kinds of people. I think it is the thing that is impossible to avoid. But in China, there are very little part time jobs for our students. I know, in Japan, university students can do part time jobs not only as a fraulein but also as a waiter, a librarian, even a cook and so on. I think it is the reason why the students in Japan are morn self-support than our Chinese students. In China, many students don't want to do part time jobs because they think it can make them lose countenance. But I don't think so. I think do part time jobs can make our students step into the society, then we will know the importance of study. Knowledge can make us richer than only do jobs with our hands. So I think do part time jobs are very necessary for our university students. I also want to do many kinds of part time jobs to make myself much stronger."
214,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As far as a qualified modern college student is concerned, I approve of the opinion that It is important for college students to have a part time job. From my point of view, it can not only relief our parents' burden but also enable us to make good preparation for our social life in the future. It is well known that the campus is called ivory tower, and it is also very obvious that students should pay most of their attention on their professional knowledge. But on the other hand, college students in modern time should also have a good knowledge of the world outside. And a part-time job is just a good chance to contact the society and learn more practical things that can't be learned at school. For example, as for me, I am doing a part time job as a private teacher. I think it can offer me some money to do whatever I want without ask my mother. And what's more important is that through the part-time job, I have learned how to balance my study and other things batter. I also learned how to get well with different kinds of people. I also did other kinds of part-time before. I learned much from my experience and these are all prepare for my future work. There is no doubt that a part-time job can offer us the chance to know the world outside better which may awaken in us a high sense of duty and help us make greater achievement in the future. Therefore, I think it is important for college students to have a part time job."
326,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Nowadays, as we all see, there are always some people like to smoke in public places. They enjoy smoking one after another without caring about the people around. In my opinion, smoking in public should be forbidden. I remember that when I was in high school, I had to go to school before 7 o'clock. However, the school was far away from my home. So my timetable was tight and stable. Then almost everyday I had to take the lift full of smoke, that means there was a guy enjoying smoking in a public place without any guilty before I took the lift everyday. So I had no choice but to breathe in the second-hand smoke. It made me sick. The smell was so strong that I would feel like vomiting. That was a terrible experience. As we all know, smoking is very bad for people's health, and the second-hand smoke is even more poisonous. A smoker not only destroys his own health, but also others close to him, especially his friends, his family and his lovers. Smoking is just like a monster which kills one little by little. Even if one doesn't care about himself, he should also give up smoking for the sake of the people around him. It is reported that a cigarette can even kill a little baby. How terrible it is! So I think even if forbidding smoking can't be accepted by everyone, the government should forbid smoking in public."
001,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we know, smoking is not only harmful to people's health but also to the environment. Smoking can deal to many diseases, such as the cancer of lung and so on. So it is very important and necessary to stop people from smoking in public place, especially in all restaurants. There is 3 reasons for that. The first one is, restaurants are the public places that people have meals, so keep the air clean is a duty of everyone. Smoking can generate dirty smoke to pollution the surrounding air. There are a lot of harmful substances in the smoke, it is no doubt the harmful substances will sticky on food and then they will be eaten by people. So you can imagine how unhealthy the food. I think no people will like this environment when eating. Secondly. What more serious is, the people sit around the smokers have to breath the second-handed smoke, that more harmful to their health than the smokers'. Smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers. Ratio of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So smokers should think more about the other people, should not build their habit over others' health. All in all, I am agreed with the government ban smoking completely at all restaurants in the country."
266,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Restaurant is a public place. Smoking in the public place is not a polite behavior. Imaging the restaurant is not in the open air. if the smoke is created, it must be a long time when the air become clean again. Eating in the smoke is not a happy thing at least for me. When we get into the restaurants, we must enjoy meals. We go to restaurants for meals, it's a special time. As we know, the second-hand smoke is harmful to people. Smoking in the public place is to do the things that harm others. Those people who smoke in public should be punished. In another way, smoking is bad for the smokers himself. The nicotine which is in the smoke would make smoker's lung get dark and even worst would lead cancer. The health is the basis of everything. Sacrificing the health for smoking is not wise decision. In a word, smoking in the restaurant is not only bad for others, but also for smoker himself, so I think smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants."
354,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Being a student in university, we've to manage a large quantity of time rationally ourselves. Many students ride the wave to take part time job after their series of everyday courses, claiming that taking part time job not only values their leisure time but also earn them a good amount of pocket money. However, things don't usually go as what we imagine. Many of them focus more on the job but care less for their courses. As a result, they would fail to pass an exam while earning a good salary. Students work that way just cannot figure out what is more important between courses and part time job. First of all, our students' toughest and most important task is to learn lessons well and get professional knowledge. That is what comes out first as a student. Nevertheless, it is not that we ought not to take part time job, but we should strike a balance between courses and job. Truly, we do have plenty of free time at hand. Pick up a job which is fit for our routine. Maybe the job takes 2 hours in Sunday afternoon, which means it won't occupy the time we need to go over our lessons and put a finger on relevant research into our major. From my point of view, taking part time job is just a way of killing leisure time at hand. Since we are living in our lovely campus, we have more than enough joyous ways of spending time and creating a period of happy memory. If job isn't perfect, why not try another way. In short, let our part time job well value our leisure time."
132,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I completely agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because I think that it will bring us many advantages. First, there will be a chance to increase our experiences if we have a part-time job. As someone says, experience is money. Taking part-time job makes us adjust to the society in advance, and found a foundation on our future life. Second, through the part-time job, we will earn some money and help us realize how hardly and difficult when our parents raise us. Third, as the society developing, the comprehensive people will be more and more important. Communicating ability will play a more important role in our daily life. Taking part-time job may make us improve it and make many friends which are our power when we meet something. Finally, it is also a leisure time. When we study day after day, some suitable leisure time will relax our physical and mental so that to increase our efficiency in study. So because of the reasons we can say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. If you have a chance, please try it. I believe you will never regret."
133,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ My many college students are doing a part-time job. Some of them usually spend one day working outside on the weekends. Others often do this as possible as they have free time. I am also looking for a part-time job. I think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job. There are some reasons. Firstly, we are still studying and we have no career. We ask our parents for money. If we take a part-time job. we will have extra money, which not only reduces our parents' pressure, but also gives us more choices to buy things we want. Secondly, doing a part-time job is a challenge for us, because we are studying in school now and we have not constructed with the society. Doing a part-time job can aboarden our horizon and we will have a better understanding of our future jobs. In addition to this, we can know the rule in the job field ahead. The last point is that doing a part-time job give us a good opportunity to make more friends, which is very important for us to development better. In a conclusion, as far as I'm concerned, doing a part-time job has a lot of benefits: Our abilities are improved and we are becoming denpendent and so on. We only need deal with the relationship between study and the job well."
109,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, it is universally acknowledged that smoking really does harm to our health. The sign of No Smoking can be seen everywhere in public places, such as vehicles, hospitals, of course restaurants and so on. So I'm for the idea that smoking should be prohibited at all the restaurants in one country. For one thing, assuming that a restaurant is crowded with a number of smokers, how can the others around have a meal in such an atmosphere. Probably, the smoke can result in the disgust of other customers, who are considered to belong to the so-called indirect smokers. If they have been in a situation like that for a long time, their health will be ruined sooner or later, what's worse, there even exists a possibility for them to get a cancer. For another, there are so many things easily to cause a fire especially in a restaurant that we should focus more attention on smoking. In case that people casually throw away smoked cigarettes in a restaurant, I can't imagine how severe the consequence will be. It's high time that we took some efficient measures to prevent people from smoking in public. Taking our health and safety into consideration, we may as well avoid contacting with smokers too frequently."
108,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In many public places, you can see signs of ""no smoking on the wall. Because restaurants are one of the public places too, of course, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants. Smoking is bad for the health of smoker and others. It can cause bad things, such as lung disease, lung cancer and some other health problems. We stand pain when we fall ill, apart from this, in order to treat the illness; we spend money like water. It adds to the mental strain and financial burden on our family. When you smoke in the restaurants, people who don't like smoking have to bear the terrible smoke around you. Their health will be affected too by the smoke. You have no right to do so. In addition, smoking is one of the reasons that cause fire. There are many cases about fire disaster in restaurants every year. A part of the cases are caused by smoker. They throw cigarette ends and ash inappropriately. At last, by coincidence, fire breaks out. In the accidental there are the results of inevitable. If every smoker is careful enough and obeys the rules, fire disaster would reduce. In a word, smoking should be banned at restaurants as well as in other public places. It's good for everyone! Each of us must take responsibility for our own actions."
093,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. There are some reasons:There is some nicotine that is something poisonous in cigarettes, so smoking has a bad effect on health. Because of this, law says that cigarette case have to show smoking is harmful to health. But there are so many smokers. Why? Although cigarette is bad for health, it brings benefits for people. For example, when you are tired after a long day's work, maybe smoking a cigarette can help you have a good rest. And when you are anxiety, it can calm you down quickly. So many people know the harm of smoking, they smoke yet. Even somebody take smoking as a habit. But smoking will not only affect smokers, but also affect people around smokers. So it is necessary to respect smokers' power and habit and to ensure the health of others. So I think smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, we can set up a smoking area and some language tips in all restaurants. In this way, we can ensure smokers and non-smokers' power and benefits at the same time."
194,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿With the development of the society, so many college student choose to take a part time job. From my point of view, I think it is very important. There are too many advantages of it. First, a part-time job can help you pay for normal living expenses, including some food, books, and clothes. Then, we shouldn't ask the money from our parents, because our parents are very painstaking. What's more, your parents will not be around you forever, and so you have to become responsible for all of your expenses. The sooner you begin this process, the faster you will become independent finally. That's the point I think. Second, a part-time job during college can build your character I think. Most of the jobs to college students are very humbling. Maybe I think they hold the view that we are just college students, we still don't know much about the salary. But I think after you experience life as a waitress,, or a sales clerk, you will become that much more grateful for the opportunities. Because it is priceless for your later work in the future. And you will realize that the world does not give you something free, and that if you want to get something, you have to give something first. In conclusion, a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. You will learn some personal responsibility and experience that you can't learn from the book. If you find a part-time job that is tolerable, you can do it well and it is important to you!"
195,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Recently, there is a phenomenon that many college students take part-time jobs in their spare time. In accordance with such a phenomenon, a constant debate has been arisen. Anyway, I agree with the idea that it is good to do a part-time job. However, it is unfair to say which is better than the other if we do not see both sides of the story in the following paragraphs. Some people believe that taking a part-time job certainly brings about several advantages. On the one hand, by taking a part-time job, students can acquire a lot of valuable experience, which will enhance their ability in future. On the other hand, students can learn how to get along well with each other and know society better and deeper. However, other people stand on a very different ground. They hold the view that it is harm to do a part-time job. To begin with, when the students do a part-time job, the study will be neglected. Meanwhile, society is complicated, the majority of students cannot protect themselves, and a lot of parents worry about their children will be cheated. From my perspective, I believe that if time permits, college students should do a part-time job. After all, to take a part-time job provides the students with a valuable opportunity to put what he has learned form books into practice, which will have a profound effect on their future job markets."
268,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ It is a factor that as a college student, we are not working. But are we lack of money? The answer must be no to a huge number of students. Yes, we are using our parent's money, they are glad to give us money, and we are happy to accept it, both of us take this phenomenon for granted. But, the money that comes from our parents isn't our own money. As for me, I will feel guilty if I waste money that comes from my parents, I will feel very uncomfortable if I use that money to buy presents for my friends, even if my parents agree me to do so. Many students will ask: if you don't use your parent's money, who are they earning money for? Why are they working so hard to earn money? Will their efforts be in vain if you don't accept their money? it may be right to some scale. However, if your parents don't have the ability to earn money? In fact, as a college student, we have the ability to earn money, why don't we do that? College life will be dreary if we don't make full use of our spare time. So, why not try to take a part-time job? Taking a part-time job can enlarge our knowledge of the society, and at the same time, we are making preparation for our future job. Therefore, I think it important for us college students to have a part-time job."
269,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿A serious problem has arisen in recent several years that more and more college students abandon study because of their taking part-time jobs, so quite a few people are opposed to part-time jobs. However, taking part-time jobs has more benefits than its shortcoming for college students in my points. Firstly, students can promote their study through part-time jobs. For instance, If a law student finds a part-time job in a law firm, his practice will enable him to better understand what he's learned from books. What's more, the part-time job can offer him opportunities to go beyond what he's been taught in class, and he'll learn something that doesn't exist in books but in practice. Secondly, students can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job-hunting. Actually, part-time jobs act as warm-up exercises for students to take full-time jobs after they graduate, and help them prepare for their future careers. Besides, as fresh blood of the society, graduated students are often fall in job-hunting markets for lack of practical work experiences, but part-time jobs can solve these problems easily. Last but not least, part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families. A fact we can not deny is that the cost of finishing college have greatly increased in the past time. Many students from poor families cannot afford college fees, and our bank system fail to loan college students as effectively as it does in developed countries, so taking part-time jobs becomes a way for them to meet their great expenses in campus lives. It's an indisputable fact that students break the balance between their jobs and studies, especially when they fall into conflict with each other. So I think students should spend their spare time taking part-time jobs. Only following this way can they benefit from their spare time mostly."
035,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As to the topic, I think smoking is supposed to be completely banned at restaurants in the country. First, restaurants are public places where people go to have their meals. If you are a non-smoker and hate smoking very much and you find yourself surrounded by smog when you are seated in the restaurants, what is your feeling? Do you still in a mood to eat? In this case, smoking in a restaurant leads to other customers' unhappiness and the atmosphere won't be good. On the other hand, we should let smokers know how to behave differently in various occasions. Smokers should be taught to respect others. By not allowing them to smoke at all the restaurants in the country, we are reminding them the above necessary qualities. Then, as we all know, second-hand smoking does great harm to people's health. People may have cancer if exposed to second-hand smoke for a long time. To protect people from being sick, and assure them a healthy environment to enjoy themselves, smoking should not be allowed by all the restaurants in the country. Above all, in the long run, if smokers are banned from smoking at all the restaurants in the country, they will gradually get used to it. By then, the world will be a wonderful one to live in. In a word, it is a pretty good idea to ban people from smoking at all the restaurants in the country."
253,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking has been a serious social problem for a long time. In our country, several millions of people smoke every day. What is worse, everyone on the earth suffers the air pollution. We should take immediate measures to forbid the smoking before our earth is destroyed thoroughly. Every day, a large amount of people have died of lung cancer because they smoked a lot when they lived. As we all know, smoking kills our health gradually so that our bodies become weaker and every organ come down until we can not breathe and walk. Smoking is such a horrible killer that we can't see. Smoke is not only harmful to person, but also plays a much worse effect on our environment. When one person is smoking, people around him will have the second-hand smoke at the same time, which can leads to serious disease like cancer. On the other hand, smoke contributes to the greenhouse effect which makes our earth become hotter and weather is changeable. Maybe it seems to make no matter as we see today, but in 10 years, we must regret and can only cry to hate ourselves. Look the dying people, look the declining animal series, and look the grey environment. I strongly propose that we mustn't smoke any more."
252,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Suppose you are sitting around a beautifully decorated round marble table with your best friends and you are enjoying delicious food. Suddenly, a blast of smoke came into your nostril. What's your feeling then? Here comes the discuss---should smoking in the public be forbidden? As for me, positively, the answer is yes! When you are in the public place, you are not only represent yourself, but also a person related to all. You may think smoking can refresh yourself and make you cool, you may think you only damage your health, you may think others do not care for your behavior. But there is one thing you have to remember---smoking in the public is not good. The smoke from your lung can easily spread to others' lung, although they do not want that happen. The second hand smoke can be more poisonous. Besides, the bad smell of smoke can also influence one's mood thus he or she could not concentrate on the important things. What's worse, smoking in the public can result in the teenagers' smoking, which may cause worse problems in the long term. I appeal all of us to forbid smoking in the public and make our environment better, make our society more harmonious."
034,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As smoking can cause lung issues and has a stronger effect on the surrounding people, some politicians hold the view that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in this country, which I can hardly approve. I have the following reasons to clarify my point. Firstly, in terms of health, it is undeniable that cigarette is not the only thing that does harm to our body. Should we ban all the fried food just because they are junk food? I think the answer should be no. Secondly, smokers' choices determine smokers' consequences. It's not our business to interfere others' lifestyles compulsorily even though it can kill them gradually. As we cannot ban suicide, we cannot ban smoking. To make us free from the infection, restaurant managers can set smoking rooms to satisfy the smokers without affecting the other customers. And we can put posters to remind the smokers the risks they are taking. But forbid? No. I agree that smoking is the last habit we could form, but since it is a controversial and complicated social issue, we should handle it carefully instead of simply forbidding it completely. We can solve the problem through different kinds of methods gradually."
360,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Many students now have part-time jobs to earn some money. Some of them wash dishes at restaurants. Some teach children on weekends. They all do jobs in their spare time to earn money. On the one hand, they can really live better with more money. On the other hand, they don't have enough time to study. So part-time job is not necessary for a student. Students need time to study, but part-time jobs take over their spare time. Study is the most important job for a student, so one cannot give up time which should be spent in studying. If a student do part-time job, he will lose more than what he earns. Part-time jobs are not safe enough for students. Compared with other places, campus is the safest place for students. Students do have to get out of their campus to do their jobs. This means they may be hit by cars or stolen. All dangerous things may happen to students. Some students may have financial problems and they may take part-time jobs to solve this. But they should consider this problem once more. Is part-time job the best answer? No! It will never be the best answer. They should chose study and safety instead of money."
106,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays more and more college students go out to have a part-time job in the society. I think it is a good sign. First, we can take some money from a part-time job, which can reduce the family burden. It is uneasy for our parents to raise us and now it's time for us to do something to let our parents relaxed. Second, it is a good chance to get to know society. We can learn something that we can't learn in college. It will be helpful for our future work. At the same time, we can find out which job we are interested in and are really good at. Last, we can meet more people. Some of them may become our good friends. In the last summer holiday, I became a private teacher. I taught math and English to a student in high school. I learn how to communicate with her better and learn some English that I didn't study well when I was in high school. After the teaching, my student becomes my good friend. she is younger than me and her thought is different with me and my former friends. I learn many thing from my student. Because of the teaching, I felt very substantial in the holiday. Through this experience, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
107,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is not rare to see many students are doing part-time jobs when they are in college. Moreover, it seems that more and more students are doing part-time jobs during recent years. I don't support the idea that college students should have part-time jobs. And I have specific reasons for not agreeing with it, which are explained in the following paragraphs. Having free-time jobs is a waste of time. Consequently, college students will have less time to do other things. I can think no better illustration of the idea than the example of my roommate. For instance, my roommate Sun who have six part-time jobs is always exhausted. He doesn't have time to study what he should learn and have no time to exercise. Obviously, it is bad for his schoolwork and his health. Furthermore, he even doesn't have a girlfriend. What a poor boy!There are many people in the world are cheaters. In other words, you probably work day and night and gain nothing. Actually, the situation is not rare, it is just one of many examples I have encountered. For example, my roommate is Liang. He works for a factory for nearly one year. However, the manager of that factory disappears forever. Liang gains nothing. What a gloomy world. From the above, doing part-time jobs may have many disadvantages, so I don't think it is good for college students to have part-time job."
361,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In universities, we can easily find a fact that many students are willing to find part-time jobs to get more money so that they can pay some parts of their tuition. As this tendency is becoming more and more common, many people have expressed their views, such as support, disagreement or suspicion. As a college student, I also have a part-time job in a shop. In my opinion, it is really a good way to develop our ability so as to understand the world we live in. When we are free, a part-time job will certainly make our life colorful and meaningful, and that's why I enjoy it very much. Many people think it useless and harmful, because they don't believe the part-time jobs can give students any experience or help, and they also believe strongly it will influence our study and grades. But I want to say if we stay at home all day, we will never know what the real society is, and if we only focus our attention on marks, we will certainly be abandoned by this world. We are not the kids anymore, and this society requires us to gain something from practice so that we can easily adapt to it when we get close to it one day. To tell the truth, although the money we can earn when we join a part-time job is not pretty satisfied, it doesn't matter. Maybe we should know that the more failure and pain we experience, the more close the success is approaching to you. This is my own view on part-time job, and I wish more and more college students can get happiness and success from this wonderful way!"
288,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I think everyone will agree that smoking is harmful to people's health. In human society, smoking in public is seemed as some rude behavior, no matter what country and culture you live. Smoking has such bad effects as follow. Firstly, it will cause apparent damages to your lung. Most people smoke just for the temporary comfort when they are in trouble. They say smoking can help release their mental burden and forget all problems for a while. When people feel nervous upset or worried, smoking comes to their final choice——the only comfort. That may explain why so many people are addicted to smoking. But does it real work, I don't think so. Secondly, smoking will do much more harm to the people around the smokers. Especially for children and pregnant women, smoke will bring incurable influence to them. According to some statistics, smoking is the main cause to lung cancer. Every year, the amount of people dying from lung cancer is incredible, just less than the amount of death caused by car accident. Sometimes we say that smoking is an invisible killer. At last, smoking should also cost much money, and that will add one man's financial burden. Even smoking may also bring family conflicts."
047,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿We always read some news that talk about the modern college students' lives. According to this news, we find more and more college students prefer to have part-time job. Personally, I disagree with the opinion that having a part-time job is important. Nowadays the more colleges appear, the more college students appear. Firstly, we'll see more students who aren't rich enough to live in the city have appeared and have no choice but only to find a part-time job to support their living or studying. Obviously, most of us have no need to do that. Secondly, maybe we do not have more money to buy some clothe or other things, but unnecessary to worry about we can't continue our studying or normal living. Thirdly, for us, the most important thing is studying. After we've finished our works, then can we choose whether to have a part-time job or not in spare time? I agree with having an experience of part-time job is better for us to fit the society, but disagree with having the job can instead of having a class. Students dream one day they will be a rich man, such as Bill Gates, without graduated-degree can also earn money. Actually, only few of us can success. Most people still need to study and work hard to have a better life. We should realize our duties are studying not spend all the time on exercising living ability. In the words, I don't think college students have a part-time job is important."
174,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking in public places has become a big issue in today's society. Today, we will discuss whether the smoking in the restaurant should be banned. On the one hand some people think that banning smoking in the restraint is unfair to smokers and takes away from their freedom. On the other hand, however, some other people think that not banning it is unfair to the nonsmokers and puts our health in danger making it unsafe for us to go to public places where there are smokers. I agree with the latter. So we need to do something to stop smoking in the restaurant. There are a lot of harmful effects of smoking in the restaurant. Smoking affects lung and causes lung cancer. So if you smoke in the restaurant, you will harm yourself. Besides that, second-hand smoke is very dangerous for people sit round smokers in the restaurants. They don't want to be harmed by this in the restaurant. The environment of eating in the restaurant is very significant because people go to restaurants to have meals and enjoy happy time. When you have meals in the restaurant, you feel someone is smoking so your emotion is being destroyed and you will not eat any more. The environment in the restaurant is ours so that everyone should protect it. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. So everyone can have a healthy dinner in the restaurants."
175,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Whether smoking should be banned at all restaurants has become a controversial issue, arousing great public concern. Personally, I think it is a serious behavior to smoke at restaurant and we should not allow this condition. Should smoking be banned at all restaurants in our country? The answer is not so easy, of course. I think we can solve the problem in the restaurant by other way not just completely ban it. First and foremost, there's no denying that smoking does harm to the smokers and in the meantime to others. Although those people have been addicted to smoking, they are supposed to pay more attention to the others' health in public. Moreover, it is common believed that smoking destroy the elegant atmosphere at the restaurant. Therefore, I suggest that the government should create a place especially for the smokers and the problem will be solved gradually. Last but not least, educated as most Chinese people are, it is crucial for us to behave formally and gently in public. Something must be done in the restaurant to deal with the problem of whether we can smoke in the restaurant. In my opinion, we can set up a public place especially for smokers."
313,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. So the government has banned on smoking on some restaurants. But there are more disputes. Some people approve of it very much. They even think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because it is more comfortable for the non-speakers, while other people don't think so. In fact, most of them are smokers, they think it is very inconvenient for them to go to the restaurants. In my point of view, smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is true that the smoke is harmful to the non-speakers, especially the pregnant people and the child. But the population of smoking is too large. So we cannot ask the government to ban smoking at all restaurants. But there are still some methods. For example, we can imitate the policy from other countries. We can set some smoking areas and no smoking areas in every restaurant. As far as I know, some restaurants have already done it. So in this way, we can protect people's health in public, and we can also let the heavy smokers to have more room. If both sides step back, we can have a better life. So we should't ban on smoking at all restaurants."
381,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Recently, many countries put forward the policies of banning the smoking in public places, which means the government begins to put much attention on this problem. In my opinion, this banner is beneficial to the citizens' health. And we all should protect this pure environment from the harm of smoking. As we all know, smoking does a great harm to lung, and will raise the rate to have cancer disease. So no matter where should we smoke and do harm to ourselves. Not only can smoking do harm to smokers, but also the second-hand smoke can be harmful to the people staying at the public places, because the second-hand smoke can cause a large influence on our body. If a child is on the scene, the damage to his little body is even larger. It may lead to a malformation! So how can we endure a person in a public place like restaurant smoking without any misgiving? Last but not the least, the pollution of cigarettes is also one reason why we should ban smoking. Regardless of the process or the result, the pollution is both large. When we get the step to protect the environment and advocate green-products, this problem must be handled as soon as possible. After the statements, we can see the importance to ban smoking in public places! Let us pay more emphasis on the problem."
256,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Whether college students should do part time job? really puzzles many socialists, college teachers and students as well. For me, I truly support the idea that college students should do some part time jobs. And here are some reasons below. Being a college student, we shouldn't spend all his time studying like a middle school student. Although study is a very important part in college life, gaining some social experience is also essential. We can join a lot of societies or students' organizations; do some volunteer work or some part time jobs. Doing a part time job not only makes you earn some pocket money and enrich social experience but also helps you to make progress all the time and form good habits such as time keeping, being responsible and saving money after your hardworking. Many college students will go to work after graduation. So it is absolutely an advantage if you have some working experience when you apply for a job than others. And nowadays social and working experience is required in many job applications. And I do think it important to find fun or curiosities when doing part time job otherwise you will frustrate and give up halfway easily. In the end, doing a part time job is good for us in most part. And I sincerely hope that each college student can lead a meaningful and colorful college life."
031,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more college students choose to get a part-time job. Some students take a part-time job to enrich their college life. Some other students have a part-time job just because they want to get some money. Is it important for college students to have a part-time job?Personally, I think taking a part-time job is a good way to enrich our college life. We can learn a lot by doing this. And the working experience in turn will have great influence on us. Besides, we can also become independent by taking a part time job because we can earn money from doing part-time job. At the same time, we can reduce some family burden from our parents. But on the other hand, taking a part-time job may have bad effects on our study. Some students spend too much time doing part-time job and they don't have enough time for their study. So it is not very good for them. After all, study is the most important thing for us students. Having a part-time job has its advantages and disadvantages. And in my opinion, we can take a part-time job if it has little influence on our studying. So if you can keep the balance between your part-time job and your study, try to find a part-time job now."
098,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is considered that smoking do harm to people. To the person who smokes, however, may be it can benefit them in some way. People have different preferences which lead to various perspectives. Personally, I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. I support to restrict people smoking in public areas. Because smoking can not only hurt the health of smokers but also influence the passive smokers, it's reasonable to ban smoking in some public places. The restriction can help people quit smoking as well as benefit the nonsmokers. But, it's improper to ignore the feeling of smokers. People have right to do what they what if they don't hurt other ones. We all agree that it's impolite for people to smoke without the agreement of people besides. However, if smokers want to have a get-together, why can't they share the pleasure of smoking? There are two alternative solutions. One is that restaurants can set some smoking area for smokers other than rub their right to smoke simply. Smokers should have smoking area to stay while nonsmokers can choose nonsmoking area. You won't think it proper when a ninety-year-old has to smoke standing outside the restaurant in winter after he have smoked indoor for sixty years. Another idea is that government can slightly decrease the tax if the restaurants which ban smoking. For some restaurant may afraid that policy will influence their income for lose some smoking customs."
103,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I fully agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. In fact, in some countries it has been written in the law and is being carried out now. My reasons are chiefly as follows. First, smoking is harmful to the smoker's health. According to the recent survey, those who smoke are much more likely to get lung cancer than those who don't and every year many people are dying due to diseases caused by smoking habit. In this case, we should not smoke for the sake of our health. Second, smoking not only do harm to the person who smokes but also the tremendous people who suffer from passive smoking. The supporters of smoking often claim that smoking is a kind of personal lifestyle that others even the government should not interfere. However, in my opinion, if you smoke in public places like restaurants, it's no more a personal matter and it not only harm other people's health but also creates a terrible environment for others. Last but not least, if you smoke in public places like restaurants, chances are that a big fire might break out and then threatens the safety of thousands of people. Therefore, no matter it is for your own health or the others', smoking should be forbidden at all the restaurants in the country and it is high time that the government took effective measures to solve the problem."

Some of them are addict to cigarettes, so they smoke everywhere, including in public places. However, I think smoking in public places should not be allowed. First, smoking is not a good manner to others, if you always pouring out smelly smoke while others feel sick, you must be unpopular. Secondly, smoking now mainly plays the role in social interaction, not just make someone feel satisfied. Also, cigarette has a lot of harmful chemicals that will hurt your body. Every cigarette box has a sign reminding you not to smoke too much outside. In public places, people need a quiet, comfortable environment. Smoking can make one excited like coffee do, to some extent. So smoking can affect all people around you and have a bad influence. That's why I oppose to smoking in public. I think every public place should have a smoking area. This action can not only release the smokers' pressure, but also create a good environment in public places, like the old saying goes Kill two birds with one stone."
102,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more people have realized the disadvantages of smoking. Smoking is doing harm to not only smokers themselves but also some relative persons who are together with smokers. Namely, the negative influence of smoking can be passed among all of people. There are so many disadvantages of smoking. So should we have to ban smoking in the public restaurant? Of course not. In Chinese culture, smoking is always taking possession of most part in interacting. People even can't feel a perfect meal without smoking in the end. Maybe it's hard to change the habit formed several years. Besides, smoking is sometimes a way of communicating with others. During meals, some people smoke because they want someone to change the attitudes towards themselves. Some people smoke because they want to improve the relationship between others, while others want to deal with their business efficiently. Taking my family as an example. I have a big family, and of course males like smoking. My grandpa and my father as well as my uncles would smoke when women are cleaning the dishes after dinner. In their views, it's a good way to improve the emotion of families. And we are all used to that. For us, it's really difficult to change that immediately. So it's much better to obey the habit than to break despite of disadvantages of smoking."
138,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I don't agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The majority of those who do part time jobs hold the idea that it is an effective way to gain social experiences — the ideal way to make contact with other people, which everyone will have to use in the future once we formally enter our society. At the same time, parents' burden can be lightened. Entering the college means we will have more free time to control by ourselves. However, it does not mean that we can look down upon our study and do whatever we want. As far as I am concerned, doing part-time jobs is a waste of time. For one thing, if you devote yourself to study and read some books about interpersonal interaction or philosophy in order to behave yourself in public, there's no need to spend much time in serving guests or washing the dishes. For another, the economy is growing at a stable rate, therefore, our parents have the ability to pay for our tuition. This period in college is not a proper one during which we make as much money as you can for parents' good. On the contrary, we are supposed to learn as much knowledge as we can. In a word, it's not a necessity to do part-time jobs for most of us."

However, some people think that it is common and even enjoyable to smoke in the restaurant because they do have their own freedom and they have rights to do that. In addition, to some extent, smoking has been becoming parts of their lives. What's more, no smoking during the dinner may make them feel unhappy. On the contrary, other people argue that smoking should be banned in the restaurant. The reasons are as follows. At first, smoking not only does harm to their own health, but also others'. Moreover, it is undeniable that smoking is not suitable for the environment of the restaurant. We need good environment to have a meal in the restaurant. Last but not least, every customer has the same responsibility for protecting the surroundings during meals. Something must be done in the restaurant to deal with the problem of whether we can smoke in the restaurant. In my opinion, we can set up a public place especially for smokers. Thus the problem will not exist."

So the behavior influences people's feeling and cause some complaint. In their view, we should ban smoking in the restaurant. In my opinion, I'm in favor of banning smoking in the restaurant too. Some reasons will explain my idea. As we all know, the restaurant is a public place to enjoy ourselves. It doesn't only belong to those smoking person. Of course, you can smoke, it's your right, but you can consider firstly other's feelings. Second-hand smokers suffer more harmful than those smokers. Worse more, there are all kinds of person, such as children, the old people, some pregnant women and so on, are in the restaurant having their meals. The smell of cigarettes must have negative effect on them. Originally, we can have a good time with our family to have a dinner. Finally, we cannot enjoy ourselves due to smoking in the restaurant. If you can't help smoking, you can smoke outside, I believe no one can disturb and prevent you. Thus, the smokers enjoy and the others can enjoy their dinners. After the ban of smoking in the restaurant, everyone will be happy to have their dinners in the restaurants."
384,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. It's quite common to see students rushing from school to workplace. On this phenomenon, different people have different views. For my part, I think it's important for college students to do so. In fact, some people may think that it's a waste of time for college students to take part-time jobs because they can't get much money and it will be better for students to spend the time on study. However, I don't agree with it. In my opinion, although the most important thing for us is to study hard and get high marks in the final examination, part-time jobs do more good than harm to college students. As we all know, college is not only a place to read books and do homework; it provides us with all kinds of opportunities to improve ourselves. And taking a part-time job is one of the good ways to broaden our social experience. We can better understand what we have learnt in books and we can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which is very good for our job-hunting in the future. Furthermore, we meet all kinds of people when we take part-time jobs so we have to learn how to deal with them. That is, we can learn how to get along well with others and it's useful for us to enter the society. In a word, the advantages of taking a part-time job overweigh its disadvantage. It's important for us to have such an experience during college life and we will find it is really of help."

However, this opinion is now being questioned by more and more enterprises and experts, who complain that the graduates can barely do anything when they start to work. Those skeptics pay more and more attention on considering working experience of their interviewees. I agree to those skeptics' opinion that it's quite necessary for college students to have a part-time job. As it is known to all, college in China has offer students a circumstance with rather strict rules and schedule. That means, we will get more part-time and most of us will spent part time on playing, as a consequence, we will learn less and less, even not enough to feed ourselves after graduation. In addition, especially for those who want to have further study, those best commercial colleges in the world treasure working experience most. It is quite hard to get their offers, even ads, without enough working experience. For us, college students, who can hardly get regular jobs, part-time jobs become our best choice for that taking part-time jobs can we gain both working experiences and allowance. While the disadvantages can certainly not be ignored, taking a part-time job sometimes would occupy our classes and rest time. It will inevitably influence our performance. But compared to the benefits it brings, these disadvantages can be ignored. And we also can fix it by self-study and making a reasonable schedule. It would seem self-evident that it is becoming more and more important for college students to take a part-time job. Taking a part-time job graduates can not only easily integrate into our society but also more competitive to beat others to get offers to further study."
042,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants is always a hot topic among these years. And many European countries and America just have passed the law about smoking is not permitted in public places. Obviously, China has a large number of smokers. Many people have the habit of smoking, especially young boys and girls, some of them even are middle school students. No matter how harmful to smokers themselves. Nonsmokers argue that second-hand smoke is much more harmful to their health. It can cause cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases. As for me, I support this issue. Smoking poses health risks for both smokers and non-smokers. And research has found that second-hand smoke is as dangerous to non-smokers as first-hand smoke is to smokers. But nothing is absolute; I think all the restaurants can set an area for those smokers. We should protect their rights to smoke after all. And in fact smoking is just becoming a culture. Every country has it own smoking cultures. So completely banned smoking at all restaurants is not practical. Everything has two sides, smoking is also like this. So we can't say completely banned that smoking at all the restaurants, but to say that we can set a specific area for smokers. So that both smokers and nonsmokers can enjoy their meal and have a great joy during the meal."
043,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In many survey, many people agree smoking banned at all the restaurants. But should smoking be completely banned at all in the restaurants in the country? I think the answer is completely yes. As we know, some elements which contained in cigarette may damage people's body. Doctors warn that many smokers have terrible diseases like cancer and heart problems later. Hence, smoking is unhealthy habit. It should be banned in restaurants. On the one hand, it is unhealthy; on the other hand, smoking in restaurant is impolite especially western country. Also, passive smoking is more dangerous than smoking according to many doctors and health experts. In order to your health and your family's health, please not smoking in the restaurants when eating!However, people who have smoking in long time ago think it is too cruel with them if they cannot smoke in the restaurants. Maybe raise something bad. In fact, no smoking in restaurant proves smoker's quality. It means they care about others. On summary, smoking in restaurant should be banned and we need this policy. For your health and other people's health, stop smoking in public. Smoking in everywhere will make our society around pollution air isn't it? No smoking in restaurant protects our society and all the people's health."
225,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Many people smoke in the world. Though a lot of people think that smoking should be banned, the number of smokers still increases. In my opinion, I think smoking should be forbidden for that it is bad for many aspects. First of all, smoking is bad for people's health. It is common knowledge that smoking is not good for one's health. Many people die lung cancer. And the habit of smoking is one of the most significant reasons for causing such kind of disease. There is no doubt that people who don't smoke have the lower possibility to suffer this disease. Secondly, the smoke released from the burning cigarettes is also bad for the people who breathe in it. There are many kinds of poisonous chemicals in the smoke, so if a person smokes in a public place, he is not just doing bad things to his own health, he is harming others' health as well. Last, people who smoke must spend a lot of money buying cigarettes every year. With the money that one buys cigarettes, he can do many other things. Even he can give part of the money to the charity. That is much better than spending money buying cigarettes which is bad for health. To conclude, smoking has a lot of bad aspects. And I think that smoking should be banned in the near future."

Some choose to restaurants some to shops and some choose to teach students. there is many choices. As a coin has two sides, there are both advantages and disadvantages on doing part time jobs. If you do a part job you can learn many things that you don't know before, during the time you may face many problems so you must find ways to solve them, you also need to think twice before you do something, because of doing part time jobs you can also know that money is very hard to earn. You will thank you parents more. The disadvantages are that if you do part time jobs you will don't have much time to study; your study may be affected, because you are a student you should try your best to study hard and should not to consider other things. Also you may be affecting by the society people, people in society are very reality you may be hurt and lose heart to life, it is not good to your growing. In a word, you should see part time jobs in a proper way."

If you spend proper time on it, you can benefit a lot form it. Firstly, doing a part-time job can enrich the students' social experiences. He will meet all kinds of people in his job and during this period, he learns how to deal with them. This can improve his ability in communicating with others. What's more, it's not until a student makes money by himself will that he knows that making a live is not an easy thing. And in this case, he will be more understanding towards his parents and learn to arrange his money properly. However, it also has disadvantages if you spend too much time on it. For our studying time can't be guaranteed. For us students, studying is our major duty and once you have a part-time job, the problems in your job will make you cannot be absorbed in your major study fully. So, just as each coin has two sides, doing a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages. It's all up to you whether you can really learn something from it."

They will do everything when they have free time and in weekend they also spend time on their part-time jobs. In my opinion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, I think do part-time job can help college students learn to budget money. In China, many students' money was given by their parents. They can't know how hard to earn money, so they spend money quickly and waste money to buy meaningless things. But if they have a part-time job to do, they will find it is difficult to earn money themselves. They will budget money if they want use them. Secondly, a part-time job can help them pay for their living things. Such as food, books clothes and so on. They will feel success if they use their own money. Thirdly, doing a part-time job can help them to build their character and gather social experience. It can help them grow up. In today's society, it is hard to find a good job. Many jobs need experience person. In generally, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It has many advantages for college students. It can help them strength faith."
120,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, the society cannot emphasize the important than to quit smoking. It is universally acknowledged that Smoking is harmful to your health. However, whether smoking should be permitted in the restaurants or not is a serious problem to think over. There are about two sides followed about this, most people include me insist on that any public area, like restaurant, must stay away from smoking. Smoke is not only terrible for people's lungs, but also the spark maybe causes a fire. At the same time, people should observe common courtesy when they in the public places, and try their best not to affect others activity. If they are smoking, the others will feel uncomfortable without doubt. Standing on these disadvantages, they hope the country banned at all the restaurants completely. Despite its merits, it also brings some problems to solve. For instance, someone, especially some adult male addicts to cigarette, they have dinner at the restaurant sometime, maybe they thought the dinner cannot without smoke, so that they cannot help themselves to use lighters. So, I rarely reach an absolute consensus on such a controversial issue. After a thorough consideration, I suggest that the country can set the majority of restaurants without any smoke, at the same time let the minority of allowed to smoke. Only in this way, I think, maybe can solve this complicated problem."

It is not because I am unsatisfactory to himself or herself, but they quarrel between my father and my mother. My father love smoking, or said too serious a bit, he is hopelessly hooked in cigarettes. He doesn't stop smoking all day. If he has some time not smoking, he will be so painful that he even will be angry with my mother or me for no reason. For this reason, he has had words with my mother which is countless. What's worse, he doesn't just smoke at home; he even smokes in public such as restaurants and doesn't consider the others. Some non-smokers are always frowning to go far away. And when time is long, the whole restaurant is filled with a serious smell which makes the other customers very upset. For this, these managers have reminded him for a lot of times. In fact, smoking in restaurants has lots of harm. First, the restaurant is where people eat. Smoking in there will make the food become so dirty. It will be a great potential danger if someone often eats in this kind of place. And second, the restaurant is a public place, if someone smokes in there, the number of people who have a second hand smoking is very large. Especially, it is a deadly harm to the waters. A survey indicates that most of waters who get a cancer is because he or she has a second smoking for a long term. So banding smoking is a very necessary measure. For our health, everyone please contributes a little. Persuading the people who are addicted to smoking to give up smoking, especially these who always smoke in public."

Experts have announced that smoking has a more serious effect on other people not the smoker, because it conclude many gas which will cause cancer. Government has noticed that, so they take some measures to protect people from suffer the disease, but it is doubtful whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Maybe someone think it's too strict. Well, let's see; if a behavior may cause diseases in a large environment, do you want it exist? Do you want to suffer diseases? Of course not. So, not only to smokers, but also to the people around him or her, it is acceptable to ban smoking at all restaurants. First, smoking is bad for people's health. It will result in troubles at people's lung. Second, when in restaurants, people are all enjoying a beautiful meal, when there is someone smoking, the smell of cigarette would make people feel uncomfortable, angry, even mad, so as restaurant itself, it needs to forbid smoking. So, as our college students, we should avoid smoking, or at least, not smoking in public. It is a primary common sense that everyone should obey. In order to protect people's health, we need to ban smoking in all restaurants. It will do good to everyone, also restaurants."
081,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿More and more students have a part-time job nowadays. Their reasons are different. Most of them take the job as a way to earn their living expenses, while the rest of them just want to practice their abilities and to broad their horizon. On the one hand, I don't think that it is essential for college student to get a part-time job. One year before I took my first part-time job as a saleswoman, I found it really boring after I cooked noodle for 3 days. It really hit me so much; as a result, I think I will never eat instant noodles. As we are too young to take the professional task, we always play the unimportant roles. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the part-time job can exercise one's character. During the working hours, there may be many challenges for you. When you feel failed, when you get tired, and so on, it's high time to challenge yourself and to prove yourself. As every coin has two sides, taking part-time job is a good way to feel the reality and the society. You'd better try for one time. But you face with a tradeoff. We always say the words Opportunity Cost, which means when you choose something, at the same time you need to give up something. If you want more money and more experience, your studying time is being taken the place. It all depends to you. From my viewpoint, it is important for college students to have a part-time job even for just one time. But it is not essential. You have to count the cost, and then to make a decision. And making the fullest of your part time, balancing the percent of job and study also make sense."

Majority of people think it is good for the college student because they can make some money by themselves and decrease their parent's pressure. Other more, it is proud of them to own money to buy their own things. But other people think students now take over the couple's living expenses. Or put the money in to the Internet overnight; buy brand-name clothes and blind comparisons. Additionally, some college student think they know the society clearly and they can do much things over their ability. As a matter of fact, it is not a real and smart thinking. From my point of view, it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First of all, it can make student learn more real things about the true society. the job would make them feel a little successful and it can affect their positive attitude in their future life. Secondly, student can earn some money to buy the product they want to buy and release their parent's pressure. Thirdly, the part-time job can give more working experience and skills to the student.

029,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In many public places, we can often note that some people are smoking while others around them holding their noses. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking in the public restaurants is a bad behavior which put other people's health nowhere. Partly, smoking or not is a private affair, which others are not supposed to interfere in. But when it comes to the public places, smoking influences more than smoker himself but all the people there. In the restaurants, the space is very limited and people hate smoking cannot enjoy their meals when other people smoke around them. Secondly, smoking does harm to the smokers health and may even cause serious disease. We can help the smokers to quit smoking by banning smoking in all the public places. I think that most smokers lack self control. So it is better to have some laws to ban them from smoking in the restaurants. In a word, no smoking restaurants can benefit not only the smokers but also the other people around. So I insist that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country, for the public's sake."
168,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿At the first glance of the title, certainly no one can argue that many, the answer is Yes. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Recent two decades have witnessed the rapid development in science and technology. The standard of our life is highly promoted. Smoking has found its way into our everyday life and gained increasing popularity among people. Now more and more people have joined the group of smoking in the restaurant. However, we should realize the seriousness of this phenomenon. Smoking should be banned in all restaurants. There are many reasons that may account for this point, and the following are the most obvious aspect. To start with, smoking is bad for people's health. People who smoke frequently more probably have lung cancer than those who do not. Restaurant is a public place. Smoking in the restaurant affects too many people. Most people hate the terrible smell of cigarette, because it is harmful to their health. Secondly, smoking in the restaurant sets a bad example for children. Children may be so curious as to learn from them. Thirdly, to some extent, smoking in the restaurant is very dangerous. Some careless smokers may throw the left cigarette conveniently. Their behavior may lead fire. To put it into a nutshell, smoking should be banned in all restaurants. Smokers should make great efforts to give up smoking and live a happy and health life. I believe there will be a no smoking world in a short time."
207,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Although some people hold the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China, others opposite it. The people who support that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China think that smoking is not only bad for the smoker's own health, but also has bad influence on other people's health. Secondhand smoke clearly kills people and the only way to control it is to ban smoking. Banning smoking in the restaurants is very good news for non-smokers, so that they can go out of restaurants and return home without nasty smelling. What's more, smoking kills thousands of people and this is the best way to discourage people from smoking. Others, however, look at this question in a totally different way and they hold that it's unnecessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants in China. First of all, everyone has the right to decide whether smoke or not, some people believe that smoking can make them feel relax. Furthermore, the taxation of the cigarette contributes a lot to the National finance income. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants in China, a large number of people will lose job. At the same time, the customer of the restaurants will definitely reduce. As far as I'm concerned, smoking brings serious health consequence, and the pollution to other people's atmospheres also makes it an environmental issue. But I also think that people have the right to choose whether smoke or not. On the other hand, it's undeniable that selling cigarettes bring huge profits to our country and the people whose work related to it. So the best way to deal with this problem is to have the smoking area and non-smoking area in all the restaurants instead of banning smoking at all the restaurants."
060,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Everyone knows that smoking is harmful for our health. Every year, the number of people who are addicted to smoking increases sharply. Should smoking be totally banned in some public places, such as restaurants? For me, I think it is not a good idea to ban smoking completely in all the restaurants in the country. I have some reasons. Each person has their own habit. I don't think it is suitable for government to interfere citizen's choice. What should our government do is helping build a particular place for people who are addicted to smoking in public places, for instance, setting a suitable space in a restaurant for people to smoke. By doing liking these, other people who don't smoke also won't be influenced. Smoking won't be banned, if people who are enjoying their meals in a restaurant are forced to stop smoking, the development of some restaurants also will be influenced. So just think the most suitable way to solve these complex problems and provide people with their own space to enjoy themselves. We can come to the conclusion, for the development of restaurants and for people's right, we should divide restaurants into different parts. Smokers can smoke in the smoking place. The others can have meals in not smoking place and not get influenced."
206,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I suppose that smoking should be completely banned at any restaurant in china. Firstly, in terms of health, as is widely known to everybody, smoking is definitely very harmful to people's health. And what is worse, people who are around smokers will get second-hand smoking which does even more serious damage to health than the smoker himself. I suppose we can put it as harm set, harm get. It is quite easy to imagine a picture that in a restaurant, which is quite limited space, customers are talking and eating happily, however, several smokers make the restaurant foggy here and there, and while the other customers are enjoying themselves, unconsciously, inhaling victim smoker all the time and very likely to be suffocated by the dirty air. Especially when children is in this restaurant, I can hardly imagine what effect will it do year by year, but no doubt, things will turn out terrible. What's more, if the smoker uncarefully drops the cigarette on the carpet or doesn't stub the cigarette out completely, it will quite probably cause an accidental fire, which is apparently a very dangerous thing. From my point of view, smoking is really troublesome and has potential risks. I advocate that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants in china."
335,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I support the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. My reasons are as followed. First, when doing a part-time job, college students will get to know how hard it is to make money. As a result, they will learn to save money and won't waste money on unnecessary things. In a long run, students will be able to save money all through their lives. I consider that it is very profitable for student's career. Second, students who get a part-time job will be able to be accustomed to the society more quickly than those who don't. They will make fewer mistakes than others. So when searching for a job, students who used to have a part-time job will be more competitive and there is more possibility for them to find a better job. Third, also the last one, students who used to get a part-time job at college can deal with relationships better than those who don't. When working for a company, those students who can deal with relationship well will get more opportunities. This also promises a better life in future for them.. As mentioned above, I think that it is better for a college student to do a part-time job."
153,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think that it is important for college students to find part-time job. In present society, an increased number of students go in society to find part-time jobs. It is popular for college students to find a part-time job. That is why I support the idea that it is important for college students to have part-time job. In my opinion, as college students, we should not focus only on our study. We are adults now and we cannot stay in a so-called safe environment. We should step into the society to know exactly the world and meet more kinds of people. This will make good preparations for your future after graduation. You can learn a lot by doing part-time jobs. You will be more mature and responsible. Contacting with different kinds of people will enable you to become good at dealing with them in the future. On the other hand, you can earn money from it. Thus you can lose the burden of the family. And you can buy things you want with the money and help others who have financial problems. In one word, finding a part-time job carefully is important and useful no matter to yourself or the family. You can practice yourselves and earn money, isn't it wonderful. But you must be careful when finding it."
271,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, many countries have released many laws to forbid smoking in public places. I think it is a good choicce. Smoking should be forbidden in public places. As everybody known, smoking is bad for health. Smoking being forbidden in public places will force those smokers to lower the chance to smoke. It is surely good for smoker's health. Besides, If smokers smoke in public places, many non-smokers will turn to second-hand smokers silently, especially those kids and women. It not only harm their health, but also damage the right of non-smokers. Some researchers say that second-hand smoking will lead to a higher chance of lung disease. Secondly, smoking in public places can easily lead to fire. Some of the Smokers always drop the cigarette ends everywhere. Just imagine that the cigarette end are still firing with the woods nearby. What a horrible scene! According to some experts, many fire disasters are result from cigarette ends! Last but not least, smoking in public places can be make teens to smoke. Many teens see the smokers smoking in the public places, they may think it is cool, then they follow it, then more and more teens smoke. Situation become worse and worse. So, it is really a good choice to forbid smoking in public places!"
017,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ It is very common to see men smoking in restaurants in China. If you fall into the habit of smoking, it will be very hard for you to unlearn it. As it is known to all, smoking really does harm to our human beings' health. Cigarettes contain a lot of nicotine's and they are harmful. Many heavy smokers get lung cancers after smoked a period of time. Smoking not only does harm to the smoker himself, but also has a bad effect on the health of people around. Which been called ""second hand smoking "". It is very harmful to the public health. In the restaurant, when people are having meals, if other people smoke around them, their health will be affected. Smoking also influence the mood of people nearby. If someone is smoking in a restaurant when we are eating, we will feel annoyed and lose a good appetite. Therefore, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in the country, but of course can be allowed somewhere else. Our government should do something to support this suggestion, such as publishing some laws and rules. What is more important, people ourselves should try our best to obey the laws and rules. Then the health of our people will be improved greatly."
343,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Though having a part-time job can offer college students an attractive income and an opportunity to experience daily work, it is still not important for college students to have one. In my opinion, a college student's most important task is to study hard and have a better understanding of his major. But when he has a part-time job, he has to put some of his energy, sometimes most, into it. We can imagine that if someone threw himself into a part-time job, what will happen to his study. In the meantime, part-time job itself has some problems. Sometimes if we get a part-time job in an informal way, it will have some unknown risks: sometimes we cannot get paid, sometimes the job's hidden danger isn't told and we have to take risks to do it. As I know, to get some work experience is the most important reason why we have a part-time job, but what can we truly get from it? Most part-time jobs are boring and we cannot get anything from it. So why don't we just do some volunteer work instead of having a part-time job to get work experience? It is much better. And we can have a freer schedule to deal with our study."
125,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, the question whether college students should have a part-time job or not has attracted many people's attention. Some people think students should have part-time jobs to train themselves for future. Others say that students should not have a part-time job because study is more important thing for students. I think there will be many advantages for student to do a part-time job. First of all, if students do part-time job, they can learn experience and get training. They can learn knowledge they cannot find from their books in the school. So in the future, when they try to find a job, they find they have more advantages than other students. Secondly, we can get money. Some of us are from poor families. We can pay tuition and buy something we want if we earn money by ourselves. It can release our parent's burden. In China, we all think that friends are very important. We can meet many people when we do part-time jobs. They can make friends with us and we can benefit from their knowledge and information. Of course, study is still the most important thing for us. We should take care of both study and part-time job. You cannot spend all the time in part-time job. If we make careful plan, it will be ok. All in all, I think there are more advantages doing a part-time job because we can get experience, more friends and money. If you can have time, try to do a part-time job."
124,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿With the increasing pressure of the difficulty in looking for a good job, more and more college students choose a part-time job as a way of adapting to the society earlier and easier. It's also a controversial topic whether we should have a part-time job or center on the knowledge taught in the college. However, as far as I'm concerned, one coin has two sides, but it's vital or us to get some experience before stepping into the colorful stage of society. At first, the knowledge from the books is very limited and it's very hard to put the theory into practice just in the campus. Putting what you learn into reality is the symbol of absorbing the knowledge fully. Besides, part-time job gives us a great opportunity to contact the people from all walks of life. A good interpersonal relationship also plays a very important role in our career. Last but not least, part-time job is a job we can earn some money from. This may not be the most important, but the salary we earn by ourselves can give us a sense of treasuring the money earned by hard work. What we give equals to what we get. To sum up, part-time job is a good way to get more social experience; we college students should attach more importance to it no matter what you want to get from it. If you want to be superior to others after the college, just have a try in advance."

As a university student, I think it is important to have a part-time job. I have three reasons below. First of all, from primary school to now, it is our parents who are supporting us to study. We have not spent one coin, which is earned by ourselves. We are no longer children; we are adult now. So we have the responsibility to support ourselves. To have a part-time job is a good choice. Secondly, the life at college is not so busy that we don't have any spare time. As a matter of fact, we have leisure to do many things we like. You may spend time on computer games, or doing some reading, or learning some software or something else. Certainly, you can find a part-time job to make life full. At last, a part-time job is a job, we could gain experience in the process. We can learn how to work with others, how to adjust to different environment, how to do a plan for ourselves to have a brilliant future. It must be useful in the future life. In conclusion, I think it is important and helpful to have a part-time job."
157,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As we all know, there is a normal phenomenon that customers smoke in the restaurants. Some people think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Because smoking in restaurants has the bad effect on environment and people's health. Others believe smoking can be allowed in some special situation. Personally, I agree with the former opinion. The main reasons lie in the following facts. On the one hand, smoking in restaurants has influence in the environment. Restaurant is a place where people have meals and rest. If a lot of customers smoke in restaurants, there will be air pollution. Others who do not smoke will have a bad mood when they are eating. On the other hand, smoking in restaurants is harmful to people's health. It is obvious that when people are smoking they can absorb the polluted air. Because of this reason, people will get different diseases, such as cancer. People cannot survive longer time. So smoking in restaurants poses a great threat on people's health. Therefore, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country so as to avoid the downside. And I think everyone should take responsibility for themselves."
156,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ China has a large number of smokers. Many young boys and girls have the habit of smoking; some of them are middle school students. Even plenty of smokers have stepped into the restaurants. Most of nonsmokers hate the social phenomenon and the same to me. I hold the view that smoking should be banned especial at the restaurants. I clearly know that they inhale the second-hand smoke in restaurants that would greatly harm to our health More and more people have come to know that smoking is bad for people's health. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. Admittedly, the smokers want to eliminate their pressure and relax themselves. Hanging a cigarette at the corner of the mouth makes them feel right and sure. The key to issues is they should not hurt other's feeling, while smokers should not pollute the clean air at the restaurants and do harm to others. Second-hand smoke is almost as medically hazardous to exposed non-smokers as it is to the smoker. All in all, I strongly advocate banning smoking in public. Not only is it good for the smokers themselves but also do their great contribution to our human being and our green world."
330,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I always wonder that as smoking becomes a kind of food for some people, as cigarette is allowed in the country, why don't we set a smoking restaurant for such kind of people, in this way, they can enjoy their great meal every day, we can not be poisoned then. But in the real world, this doesn't happen, so smoking can't be some kind of food, or it is something that really does harm to us all. But why it isn't banned nowadays, and even there are so many no smoking signs in public places, some times we can still find so many cigarettes scatted and smoke flying everywhere, I can still that there isn't a god of cigarette, right? So that's not some kind of relief, just some addicted people. Smoking does no good to smokers, as well as people around him. The profile that so many cigarette companies and government get makes them by no means let this big cake fly away. No matter how far the way we still have to go to forbid smoking, at least, smoking should be banned in the restaurant now. However, smoking in the restaurant is not only harmful to people eating there, but also a worst significant, for if in a country, smoking can enjoy the same position as eating, smoking tumor will exit forever. I can't image that what may happen to the family happily eating there in the future. Maybe some time afterwards, another family will be damaged by smoking again. So for a better future, smoking should be banned in the restaurant, NOW!"

It is necessary for us university students that we should get some experience before we got into the society. The two years taught me a lot when I was in the army. It helped me to get rid of a lot of bad habits what I have before. When I left, I got lots of wealth. Not for other purposes, but for our future we should get the experiences what we can get in part time jobs. By part time jobs, we can learn to be in harmony with others. Any way, it is very good for our professions that we get in the future. Also, we can get money using our ability for the first time in our life.

We can't control other customers who do something made us unhappy. Many people don't like smoking, but some others like. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, let me write my opinion. Although not all man who smoke is bad, it is actually that smoking is a bad habit. The man has more chance to has cancer than other people, when he smoke. And more serious diseases also catch the man smoking. So we shouldn't smoke, lead someone smoking. It has many bad affects for our health. At all the restaurants, we should eat, not reject others. We need listen different opinions from everyone to make most of we can enjoy ourselves. Not if all the restaurants ban smoking, smoking may be become a strong power. And more place ban smoking, then smoker will be low, it is good for everyone in the long way. In conclusion, it is no joke that I support the way smoking are completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It will make us more health and happy from physiology and psychology."

Most smokers smoke for calming down themselves, but young person do this just for being cool. And there is a big problem of smoking in public places which is that smoking can not only effect smoker's health but also be bad for others'. So I think it should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. According to survey, people who smoke indirectly will be harmed much more than smoker himself, and smoking more will cause cancer. So people who smoke in public places are threatening the other people's life safety. It is equal to crime! When one is smoking while others are having their dinner, the smoke will fill the whole restaurant and at the same time, people who are eating will swallow much smoke and it is very bad for their health. On the other hand, the smoke will destroy the environment of the restaurant and reduce the customers' appetite. There is another problem which is of great importance, the cigarette ends that are not extinguished completely in the public will likely cause a fire. It's very dangerous. Above are my opinions. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

There are various kinds of part time jobs available to college students invilving washing dishes at restaurants, being waiters or waitresses, tutors and some even can programme for software companies if they know how to write programmes. Despite all these advantages some consider it to be a time-comsuming thing for college students who also have a great deal of courses to take. They reckon that the time we trade for money now is far less important than the time should be spent on study thus resulting in a better job in the future which means more money earned. For those who take part time jobs at college, they think that the experence of taking part time jobs is a valubale advantage over those who do not have the experence of working with peaple, experencing what it really feels to deal with the stress at work or with colleagues. Here comes the comclusion, taking part time job means extra money and experence of working but less study time.

Your lung is polluted and in fast decline for the input of too many kinds of poisonous chemicals, some of which are carcinogenic. Your teeth is strongly damaged and it's just a fantastic dream for you to have white and healthy teeth. According to some surveys, on average, smokers live several years shorter than no smokers. For people having to stay with smokers, their lung is likely to be damaged a lot. They share the same risk to have cancers with the smokers, if not higher. Though it's printed on the cigarette boxes that smoking does harm to your health, there are still a lot of people smoking. What is the reason? Generally speaking, people smoke mainly for three reasons. Some smoke out of curiosity, some thinks smoking adds to their attraction, and still some smoke to get rid of some negative moods. People usually smoke when they are appointed to accomplish a difficult task thus they are under great pressure, or when something miserable happened to them, such as breaking up with gf or bf, being scolded, being wronged. With more people dying of smoking, people pay great attention to it. Now smoking is banned in nearly all the public places, such as restaurants, buses, cinemas. Many a smoker tries to drop smoking and there has been social atmosphere of no smoking, which will absolutely help a lot in the final forbidding of smoking. However, there are still people smoking in public places regardless of the signs writing no smoking. On my way home in the winter holiday, someone smoked in the air-conditioned train, annoying many people. While scolded by people, he stopped quickly before making more people uncomfortable. To solve these things, we have to announce the aftermath of smoking to more people and finally with the efforts of all human beings, smoking can be totally banned in public places."

Smoking is such a dangerous and harmful thing that if a baby swallow an end of a cagarette, he is very likely to die and the boiled water from a bunch of them makes a effective insecticide. In addition, dozens of illnesses, like lung cancer, have close relation with it. Not only does smoking does harm to the smokers'health, but it is also a threat to the people around the smokers. It's called the second hand smoking. We shouldn't only think about the right of smokers, but take non-smokers's health into consideration. Public places, like restaurants, is where many people gather together. One's smoking will have great impact on many other people's feeling and health. If we don't banned smoking completely, it's no difference from encouranging smokers to continue smoking, which is very inhuman. As a children grew up in a environment surrounded by smokers, I do know the significance of ban of smoking in the restaurants. The smell of smoke deprives my appetite and leads to my coughing. Restanraut shoule be a place for eating, instead of committing suicide. So, for the reason I list above, I believe it makes a difference to ban smoking completely in restaurant, or even all public places."

They do not realize that their decision to have a part time job was affected by their need to begin taking some responsibilities for their own lives. Part time job give them a way to enter the society and to learn taking responsibilities. Although part time job is important, it is not the best thing for their future. They have to graduate from their college rather than drop out and get a full time job from their part time workplace. Their achievement at college promises a better future and job opportunity where they were best. Part time job is a way to get experience about the real world, the hardship to get money.

So before I entered the university, I found a part time job to relieve their pressure. My part time job was to help students in high school learning. As it was the first time I teaching others formally, I was a bit nervous at the beginning. And the preparation was not very rich. After several times, I came to get used to the job and have better and better performance. When I got my first pay, though it's low, I feel really encouraged. A part time job doesn't need to be very grate and formal. No matter how slight or dull it is, just do it. And you will find something worth. There are the topmast masters in every profession.

Some little kids lost their grandfathers, even fathers, just for some pieces of cigarettes! What's worse, a smoker may bring larger damage to people around him. So I think it is necessary to forbid smoking in public places, not only to earn the smoker himself a good body, but also give the cozy atmosphere back to the others. What's more, cigarettes are not cheap, because our country adds the tax percent to cigarettes to keep people away from it. So when smokes in public places, people may have a sense of compete. That is not good to social development. On the other hand, public places should be every citizen's not just some ones. Smoking is so bothering that it may influence people's moods. And it will also do badly to the environment. What's worse, the deserted cigarettes may bring serious effect to soil. And the less of cautious to put off the cigarettes when finished, may be a hidden danger, too. All in all, I think there are lots of benefits to forbid smoking in public places, if we really achieve the goal, we can have a more pleasant atmosphere, do good to public health and reduce hidden danger. We should call on everyone to push forward the course of smoking-forbidden."

We can find more and more people smoke in public places, such as bus stations, streets, and restaurants and so on. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the countries. I think smoking is forbidden in the public places is a measure to help people keep away from the harm of smoking. As we all know, it is difficult to stop smoking for smokers. One reason is that smoking usually becomes a habitual behavior. However, whether good or bad habits are not easy to be given up. Another reason is the effect of nicotine. It makes people addict to smoking. Besides, most smokers said that smoking can excite themselves when they feel tired or do not want to work. Now that giving up smoking is so difficult for smokers, we should give a hand to them. So it is a good way that people are not allowed smoking in the restaurants. On the one hand, this measure helps smokers to control their desire of smoking. On the other hand, it is also good for other people's health. In a word, we should take all kinds of measures to limit smoking. Health is the most important thing in our life."
244,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Smoking is harmful to human beings, especially in public. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in the country. Smoking at the restaurant may cause the problems below. Of course, the mainly problem is that smoking not only do harm to the man who smokes, but also have a bad effect on the neighbors. When one smokes, the smoke will be filled fully in the whole room, and can hardly be given off. When the others absorb it, they will suffer from the serious damage. What's more? The guests will be disturbed that they can't enjoy the meal happily. The other problem is that smoking may cause a big fire. As we all know, a restaurant should be very dry everywhere, for example carpet. If one smokes and he is careless, it's very easy to start a fire, then the result can't be predicted. Taking all people's safety into account, smoking in the restaurant is a large danger to all, so it should be banned. Small mistakes can lead to a large accident.

As for me, I firmly believe that smoking should be forbidden in public places. I can raise examples to go back to my point of view. First of all, smoking in public will do harm to others' health. As it is known to all, smoking is bad to our health. The smoke may increase the risk of getting cancer. On the other hand, if someone smokes in public place, then it equals that the others are forced to smoke together. Consequently, those who have a good living habit may be ill, and it is unfair to them. What's more, smoking in public places will do harm to our environment. Smoking in public places like parks or gardens will undoubtedly lead to air pollution, while smoking in restaurants may also make the floor dirty. It is everyone's duty to make our environment better, so smoking in public places should not be allowed. In a word, smoking should not be allowed in public places not only for sake of people's health but also for our environment. All of us ought to work together to make our environment better and make ourselves more healthy."

What the most important for the restaurant it to keep the environment clean and the dishes tidy. If the guests smoke, he or she will probably pollute the surroundings. Worse still, they might drop the smoke ask on the table or the dishes. Accordingly, it is necessary for every restaurant to prevent from smoking. Only in this way can we have a better circumstance for our dinners in the restaurant. However, there are possibly some bad effects on this action. On one hand, smoking is the sign of man. The relationship between smoking and man is as important as that between making-up and woman. Thus, man at the restaurant especially during the time of having dinner seems to be superior to others. They may feel that this is the representative of their social status. On the other hand, people like businessman sometimes smoke at the restaurant in order to cope with some difficulties and promote the negotiation smoothly. All in all, I partly agree with the point of view of banning smoking totally at all the restaurants in our country."

Most of the college students come from ordinary or poor family, only few students come from rich family. For the students come from ordinary family, they don't have enough money to live in a high standard of living; maybe they only can afford the tuition. If they have a part-time job, they are able to living better with extra money. For the students from poor family, to get a part-time job is a very good way to reduce the burden of their family. Secondly, having a part-time job is good for college students to participate in the society in advance. For example, having a part-time job such as selling is a good chance to communicate with different kinds of people in the society. The students will learn how to deal with different situation from the work. Such an experience will help students to adapt to the society better in the future. Thirdly, during the experience, student's personal ability is strengthened. It covers a wide range of ability to do a part-time job well, such as speaking ability, writing ability, organizing ability and so on. So during the experience, student's personal ability is improved gradually. All in all, it's very important to have a part-time job."

233,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Till now, smoking has already become a significant issue in the country. If you roam on the street, you will find in surprise that nearly half of the citizens are used to smoking in public, even youngsters are among them. Hitherto, smoking have grabbed billions of money from one generation and murdered hundreds of thousands of people. Now, the Pluto turns to the younger generation, the teenagers. As a result, many professors hope government to pass proper laws to ban smoking in public places, especially at the restaurants. In my opinion, banning smoking at all the restaurants is essential. Since smoking may not only do harm to the smokers, but also influence partners' health. What's more, when person is eating, one is sitting in one place and not moving. With the limited space at the restaurants, smoking can greatly damage another's body. To some degree, if a person enjoying supper with smoking smog around, he or she is supposed to lose several days life. This is a sobering fact, while the most of citizens are blind to the truth. Smokers are enjoying the cigarettes, while others are enjoying dinner in the killing smog. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, for our later generations don't leave more time for us."
054,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿We can see people with a cigarette at every corner of the world, and many governments have taken measures to deal with the problem. There are several reasons to do so. At first, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and health of people surrounds us. Some experts say that second-hand smoking is more harmful than smoking. So people smoke will do harm to non-smokers in the restaurants. It is unfair for non-smokers. So it is reasonable to ban the smoking in public places. In addition smoking shows a person's attitude. If a person smokes in the restaurant; it means he doesn't respect other people's feeling. Many non-smokers feel very uncomfortable when they smell the smoke in the restaurants. What is more, when someone is smoking around a pregnant woman, it can be very dangerous for the baby. Although many smokers say that banning smoking in the restaurants is a influence towards human's freedom and privacy, in fact, facing the death which is caused by smoking or second-hand smoking, the freedom and privacy mean nothing at all. But people do have the right to choose whether they want to have this kind of lifestyle or not. So it is really hard to ban smoking completely in all places in the country. But restaurants are public places. Thus, what we should do now is to ban smoking in the restaurants for all people's health. In a word, it is correct to ban smoking in all the restaurants because smoking is only a bad thing."
232,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Smoking cigarettes is not a good habit, because it is harmful to both smoker and people around him. So I think smoking should be strictly forbidden in public places. Firstly, smoking in public places is impolite to others. Everyone has its right to enjoy in public places, while smoking pollutes the air we breathe, thus worsen our working efficiency. Secondly, smoking is extremely harmful to our health. The nicotine contained in cigarette may get us addicted to smoking gradually. Cigarette is the chief cause of lung diseases, including pneumonia and lung cancers. According the survey of World Health Organization, more than 8000 people died of cancer everyday. However, smoking is not only harmful to the smoker's health, but it also hurts people staying with the smoker as well. It's called 'Passive smoking' and it not less harmful than smoking by oneself. Thirdly, smoking may be a threat to safety as well. Burning cigarettes may ignite things around that can burn easily, and finally cause a big fire. An unconsciously dropped cigarette end may cause a great loss of material and life property. In addition, smoking is a bad education to the next generation. In many families, sons gain the habit of smoking because his father smokes. In conclusion, smoking is an improper behavior in public places, for it's harmful in many aspects. So smoking should be prohibited in public places for everyone's sake."

The situtation has aroused a common concern about if is it important for college students to have a part-time job? Personally speaking, I adovocate college students should have a part-time job. On one hand, we know, college students have a part-time job can earn their pockets money, and in this way, it can reduce the burden of their family. Besides, they may make friends with many people from who college students can benefit a lots. On the other hand, as job markets are decreasing, unemployment among the graduates is increasing.

Taking advantage of your college free time, improving and enhancing yourself, when you graduate from college you will excel other college students and don't worry about you will face a fierce competition and cannot find a good job. In my perspective, a college student to have a part-time job has many adavantages and disadvantages. It is not only can earn money that can solve your financial crisis, but also you can learn a lot of experience and knowledge that can perfect you. So in order to have more chance than others, college students should take part-time job and make use of our free time to enhance oursleves."

Those students do most are teachers, workers, waiters and etc. These jobs always cost little time but count a lot. But for what is there such a tendency for university students to do it? As far as I am concerned, some students are not so rich so they want to earn some money to ease family's burden, some students may be eager to living on their own so that they can experience what the life is and imagine what it will be, the rest must want to earn more skills and gain more experience to win the competition in the future. As the economic crisis affects more and more countries, finding a good job become more and more difficult. So it is vital to make ourselves more and more skillful, part time job is a great choice. I cannot agree more. As for me,. I want to find a part time job this summer vocation. I want to understand the society better and find what parents have had when bringing me up. Also, I can earn money to buy something for them. for their birthday."

As we all know, everyone wants his college life to be full of colors and part-time work is one of those important colors. College life should not only be about study and activities but also conclude chances to walk into our society. Of course, there is no doubt that part-time work is a precious opportunity to walk out the campus to learn more about our society for college students. Only by part-time work can they get more precious experience which will be useful for them to find jobs after graduating. Besides, for some students coming form poor families the earned money can help them complete their college study. Moreover they can prove themselves by doing part-time work very well and become much more confident so that there will be more passion for them to study, work and live. As a result, college life will also become more colorful.

Now, I am studying in college, as what I say before, I also take part-time job, I working in a restaurant. Every day, when I go to bed, there is a great sense of satisfactory in my heart. Because I believe that people can not only get a lot of experience but also earn money during this time. The best thing what we get is that we have a colorful life in our college, and it is easy for us to get into society when we graduate. What the important thing is that most of the companies employ people based on their experience out of school. So what are you waiting for? Don't you want to help your parents to reduce their burden?

While others take the view that it is just a waste of time, because it is a distraction from college study. When it comes to me, I think that it is more a good thing than a bad thing. Here I list several advantages of college students doing a part time job: 1. We can undoubtedly improve our ability to get along with different people such as nosy consumers and strict managers, which contributes to our future working life. 2. We are bound to learn some useful skills from practice to a certain degree. Moreover, the experience of doing a part time job may help you to find a job after your graduation. 3. The incomes can be used freely. We needn't told our parents what we have bought because the money is our own reward. It really gives us a sense of being independent. In short, though doing a part time job may interfere with college students' study slightly, the advantages it brings to us is far more than the disadvantages. So, it is high time that we college students took a part time job, if only we have the chance."
208,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ From my point of view, I partly agree with the point that college student should have a part?time job. College is a very important step before enter the society. University and the society is very similar, you must learn some practical life skills in the university. But the fact is that you can't learn such skills in the textbooks in the university. I think in the university, we have more time to do something we really want to do, so why not try to seek for the chance, and do a part?time job? That will really benefit to us. Though a part?time job is not a official wok, it still quite difficult for those unexperienced. You will learn how to treat people, how to deal with the problems, also some troubles we have never met before. For us, it means enter the society ahead of time. It is beneficial. But everything has two sides, do a part?time job also has its disadvantage, if you can't balance the relation between study and work, it will influence your study After all, I think the advantages are bigger than the disadvantages. So the college students should have a part?time job."
209,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Should students do a part-time job or not differs from different students in different countries. Of course, doing a part-time job is good for students to build more abilities not only about the knowledge in the textbook. But for me, I don't think is good to do the part-time jobs. I have got a lot to do within my lessons, I really have no more time to spend on other jobs, even though I know it clearly that doing such a job is good to me. If I spend my time that should be spent doing my lessons, I think the result would be that neither I learn what I should learn in the textbook, and neither will I gin a ability that should be built by doing the part-time job, because I can't do the two things with my full heart. ] So if you have a lot of free time I suggest you to do a part-time job, selecting a job that fit to you is very important, in my opinion the best is the ones have confections with your subject in school. If you really have got a lot of works to deal with, it's better to spend all your efforts in your own studying, not even thinking about searching a part-time job, for that you can learn most things in the shortest time in school, at least I think so."

For people who don't like smoking, of course, it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurants in the country. In fact, many people say that it is justified to ban smoking in the restaurant. I agree with them. First, restaurants are public places. Smoking in them is too selfish. If smoke does harm to them, it is ok because they choose it. But other people around are harmed by the smoke too in the same restaurant. Secondly it will disturb the chatting between family and friends. When we are eating and smell the smoke in the restaurant, we feel very unhappy. We want a good place to have meals and chat with our family in the restaurant. Next is the safety to people in the restaurants. Because some people saw fire happened in restaurants sometimes are caused by people smoke there. Last, with the process of human's civilization, smoking is on the contrary of human's civilization. They are too selfish if they smoke in the restaurants. In short, as a civilized person and benefit the health of others, we should have a ban on smoking in restaurant."

Secondly, let's analyse the disadvantages to the people who are sitting or standing around the smokers. If a person who are smoking, it is not avoid letting the seconghand smoking happen. It is very uncomfortable to inhale the smoke of a cigarette smoker. The restaurant is a limited room. When we are together with a smoker who are smoking, the smoke he exhales fills our lungs and also makes our eyes water. We are not smoker, but we are force to breath smoke-filled air. It is unfair to us. So, smoking in public should be banned altogether, and the restaurant was included. We know that breathing smoke regularly, as in cigarette and other tobacco smoking, leads to increased rates of lung cancer in a dose dependent manner. It was said by the expert that tobacco smoke including secondhand smoke may also contribute to non-lung cancers more than preriously thought. Finally, for the sake of everybody's health, I suggest that smoking should complete banned at all the restaurants in the country."

So they chose to take a part time job. For others, they want to buy something expensive or too luxury for them and they don't manna their parents know, so they take a part time job as well. Anyhow, part time jobs are important to college student, so why don't we take one? Some people always say college student are so baby that we can't adjust to the society. Taking a part time job is an approach to solve the problem. It helps us understand the society deeper and multiplier. In the procession, we become more mature and capable.

College is a place to teach us how to be a good and successful person. Therefore, taking part time jobs makes us study more and the knowledge we acquaintant is more impressive.

114,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I can't agree more with the suggestion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, it has been universally known that smoking is harmful. It not only does harm to the smokers themselves but also to the innocent people around. In addition, for the women who often smoke, it can affect the health of their unborn babies greatly. Secondly, in order to smoke, the smokers have to buy cigarettes. Always a bag of cigarettes is very expensive. Therefore, heavy smokers must bear a large pay for smoking. To them, they are just taking out of their money to harm their health. It is quite unwise. Also, there will be lots of people eating at the restaurants. Smoking at the restaurants can make the restaurants dirty and influence others. While smoking, people produce a lot of harmful gas into the air. It is bad to our environment. What's more, the behavior people smoke in the public can reflect how rude they are. So in order to build a modern and peaceful country, it is a good way to put a ban on smoking in the public. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should not only be banned at the restaurants but also throughout all the public places."
373,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In recent years, more and more public places such as some restaurants and pubs announced a ban on smoking. This tendency attracts much attention and caused a social debating. Many people especially those smokers think this limit their legal rights and require no ban for smoking. But more people agree on it. I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. We all know that smoking is bad for our health, but do you know that living with a smoker is even more harmful? The scientific research shows that the second-hand smoke is much more harmful than smoke a cigarette directly. So smoking in public places can do harm to others health. So in my opinion, no smoking in public places is fair and legal. The second point is that smoking in public can have bad influence especially on young people. Children lack the ability of judgment and like to imitate adults. So they are more likely to smoke when they grow up or even before they grow up. Ban on smoking can teach them a good lesson: smoking is bad, don't touch it. Smoking in public places is dangerous. It can set things on fire and cause disasters. Many people lost their lives because of a cigarette. According to these reasons, I think people shouldn't smoke in public places. No smoking makes a healthier and more harmonious society."
086,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think so. In my opinion, college students are apart from the society. However part-time jobs make them understand the society. We all know in the society, competition more and more fierce. Many college students can't find jobs. So their pressures are very heavy. Therefore, many reasons press college students into finding a part-time job. I think a part-time job have an advantage to college students. In the first, college students are called unusually lucky person and live in the tower of ivory. Their lives are separated from the society. I think if they haven't a part-time job, thus, they haven't society experience and don't adapt to the cruel society right away. Now, I'm a student study in Wuhan University. Though I'm a student at two grades, I'm a home teacher in Hanyang. My student is a girl in a high school. I like the student; she is very lovely and hard in study. I hope she will have a big progress in study. I need to make a lot of preparations to teach her well. So I learn a lot when I do this part-time job. In my opinion, a part-time job is very important to college students."
249,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ There are amounts of people who smoke all over the world. So there is a discussion whether people can smoke at restaurants or not. I think it should be banned. Firstly, given the health of smokers, it should be banned not only in restaurant but every place. In my opinion, it is cigarette that shouldn't exist at all. Secondly, we should think of this problem from customers who don't smoke. It is common sense that smoking hurt others more seriously than smokers themselves. Restaurant is a public place where customers have equal right to enjoy themselves. However, own to those smokers, most customers' health is threatened. Do you think that is equal? Besides, the smoke from the cigarette is always held up at restaurant because of the small space and the still air, which is smoky. Usually people feel uncomfortable even cough. Certainly, they won't have their meal leisurely and happily. There is no doubt it is unfair for those people. In a word, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. I am in favor that there is sign which says NO SMOKING at all restaurants and everyone keeps to the rule consciously. Let's make efforts together to build comfortable environment for others and ourselves."

However, instead of dropping in last decade, the number of smokers has been on rising, especially of the teenagers. The situation has caused great concern among the people. There are several reasons that account for fact, but the following three may be the main ones. First of all, it is easy for teenagers to get cigarettes. Cigarettes are available almost everywhere. Today's teens have more spare money, which comes from the improved living standard of their parents. They can buy what they want, including cigarettes. Second, teenagers smoke because their adolescent years are filled with psychological problems. One of these problems, for example, is establishing a sense of identity. The teen years are the time when young people want to be more independent from their parents and from their own values. The enormous mental pressures of these years can make some people turn to smoking. Last, and perhaps most important reason is peer pressure to conform. Teens often become very close to special friends, for one thing, and they will share a attend parties and other social gatherings where it is all-important to be one of the crowd, to be cool. Even the most mature teenager might be tempted to smoke than to risk being an outcast. For all these reasons, cigarettes are a major problem facing teenagers."
341,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Recently, laws have been made to forbid smoking in public places. But in my opinions, smoking in public places should be allowed. First, many people has been addicted to smoking for a long period of time. They will surely feel uncomfortable if they keep staying in a non-smoking area. So they have to go outside alone to smoke. I think it is somehow unfair for them to do this. These people have just chose a way to lighten the pressure. And it's really hard to get rid of it. It's not proper to treat them unequally just because of this. But smoke will pollute the air in public places, definitely. Therefore, some ways should still be taken. I think that separate the place into two places which name'smoking area' and 'non-smoking area' can be a good choice. Some restaurants have already taken this. If the method is taken, smoking people can do what they like still inside the place, but not outside. And those who don't smoke or even hate smoking will be influenced little. All the people are then treated equally. To sum up, smoking is bad to some extent, but it's too strict to forbid smoking in public places."
127,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿According to the researches done by scientists recent years, smoking is bad for not only the smokers themselves, but for the people around as well, which is usually called secondhand smoke. But as is often the case we see every day, people smoke no matter they are, such as restaurants, parks and even on public transportation, thus causing so many people trouble. On the one hand, smoking does harm to people related; on the other hand, smokers also leave others a bad impression. To solve this serious problem, many countries call on people to stop smoking in public, some of them even ban people from smoking in the restaurants. This causes a wide debate, for many hold the opinion that they are deprived of their basic civil rights of a free lifestyle. However, the majority agree with this policy, thinking that it protects the most of the people. Banning smoking is necessary, taking the significance of restaurants into account, for if we have our meals with Nicotine every day, we can't totally absorb the nutrition, let alone health. Also, as most of the people think, smoking in public means a lack of social morality to some degree. All in all, banning smoking is very necessary and important. I think if everyone quit smoking, the environment will be better and we will be healthier as well."

When a cigarette is fired, it releases much harmful gases. Also cigarettes contain a lot of chemicals which are poisonous enough to make the smokers be ill. They could get diseases such as lung diseases, cancer and so on. What's more, smoking will damage the smokers' beauty because one's teeth will become yellow when smoking regularly. So except the damage to the body, nothing will it bring to the smokers. Aside from the damages to the smokers, it also does harm to the non smokers who are called second-hand smokers. The second-hand smokers breathe the smoke unconsciously. But they breathe into the harmful chemicals after all. And these chemicals will bring more damages to the nonsmokers than to the smokers. Meanwhile, it has been proven that if the second hand smoker happened to be a woman who has a baby, the baby will get more chance to be dead or abnormal when born. Harmful as it is, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In that way, we can have a healthy meal and enjoy our meal to the fullest."

Here we are going to talk about part-time jobs. I think it's important to take part-time jobs. There are three simple reasons. Firstly, we have enough time to do a part-time job. I think we have similar class schemes with each other as college students. According to my subject scheme, we have at least three hours' spare time after classes. Then look at how our classmates spend their spare time. Some of them play computer games when they are free. And some of them just surf the internet for nothing but getting over their boring time. And so on. Don't you think it's a waste of life. Second, from this we can gain many skills that will be used when we step into social life. For example, you can learn how to deal with your workmates and have a simple understanding of work. What's more you can earn some money, although the wage is very low. You can also know hard is it to earn money, and begin to understand your parents more. After that you may be more careful about your money. So it's really important to have a part-time job."

However, there is a discussion held by some people that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in china. To my own point of view, I strongly hold the opinion that smoking should be banned in all the public place. For starters, cigarette does not only do harm to the smoker's body, the smoke when the cigarette burning contends nearly all the poisons that the cigarette has, if you smoke in the public area like restaurant, the smoke would affect other person's health who don't smoke at all! At the same time, the smell of the smoke may make the surrounding clients feel uncomfortable. Furthermore, teenagers do not have a formed standard, they do not have a clear thought on what is good or not. If they thought it is cool smoking outside, they may firm the habit that they could not easily get rid of it since they are children. Therefore, I it is necessary for our country to banned smoking in the public like restaurant.

As far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China. As is known to all, smoking is really dangerous. It is toxic and does harm to people's lung damagingly. It not only does harm to those who smoke but also does harm to people surrounding. Moreover, people who smoke will be addicted to it gradually and it is really difficult to drop the habit. If people smoke at the restaurants, we will not have a good atmosphere to have meals. We can not imagine how scary it would be that the air would not be clear any longer but full of smoke. We will feel that the food would not be tasty any more. That would only lead to cough. Thus, in order to have a better environment for the public, there should be no smoking at the restaurants. To sum up, smoking is of no use. Those who are addicted to it would better kick it out as soon as possible just for you and for the public."

Some people are strongly against smoking in every restaurant while others insist that smoking in restaurants should be allowed for reasons below. The former says that smoking does harm to people. It can cause some deadly diseases such as lung cancer. Be it smokers or second-hand smokers, their health is all at risk. Besides, they consider that restaurants are public places where people want to have fun. If smoking is allowed in restaurants, the non-smokers may get annoyed and fail to have their meals with joy as they want. The latter takes it for granted that smoking should be allowed in restaurants for several reasons. First, smokers have the freedom to deal with their own business. They pay for the foods and service so that they ought to enjoy their time in restaurants. Second, smokers pay a high tax to government, so they believe that they make contribution to society. Smoking is the rights they get in return. As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned in every restaurant as soon as possible. Not only smoking does harm to smokers, but it also affects non-smokers' health. To ban smoking in restaurants will be a double-win choice."

If we have some working experience before we take a formal job, we will do the job better and live a better life. Secondly, the average age of college students' parents is more than forty-five. If we have a part-time job, we can lighten the pressure on our parents. Last but not least, going to college is to let us get more skills and experience and form good characteristics. Having a part-time job can also help us in these. When you are criticized by your boss, you must be patient and take responsibilities for your fault. When your colleague say bad words behind you, you must keep calm and find where you are wrong. Some people will argue: What if college students who take a part-time job failed in exam? Don't be frightened. The courses in college are not very heavy. We have lots of free time after school. We can also meet different kinds of people and make friends with them when we take a part-time job. By the way, I feel really happy when I get the money for my first job. So, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."

As far as I am concerned, it is important for college students to have a part time job. Taking a part time job is a good and important experience for a college student. Part-time job, if we arrange it well, it will not make any function to our study At first, students can get exercise, and get working experience. At the same time, they can get good knowledge during the working time and they will form good ability. Then students can earn some pocket money so that it can reduce the burden of parents. They need not to suffer too much to support your fee to go to school. It is good for the whole family. Then it makes we know how to work in society, how to make money, how to live in society by oneself. With the part-time job, we will abundant our social knowledge and other things. So, when we are college students, it is necessary to do such work. This experience will be unforgettable memory of our school year. And we can benefit a lot of things from it.

As college students who will soon facing the cruel competition, what should we do to get ready for it? Then doing a part-time job may be a top option. It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, we all know that college is a transitional period between school life and social life. Therefore, it is a golden chance for us to make preparations for the coming social life. Doing a part-time job is just a tool or means to help us to adapt to social life, and meanwhile widen our horizon. What's more, students as we are, we can't bury ourselves into those books day and night. We need to be exposed to something fresh. Doing a part-time job can not only tell us how to deal with things, but also guide us how to be a person. It is favorable to improving our abilities and widening our ken. Last but not least, we will gain a sense of satisfactory from the harvest of the part-time jobs. No matter how much we get, it is the biggest award for us. To sum up, having a part-time job is necessary and very important for college students. I believe all of us can be qualified to a real social job when we graduate from universities."
332,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays many college students choose to take a part-time job for the purpose of obtaining more social skills. I really agree with them. Firstly and most importantly, the student will join the social competition sooner or later., but what they learned in school is just the professional knowledge, which is just made up small part of their social lives. It's the abundance of social activities that make interviewers deny their ability,. But if they have the experience of working outside, situation will totally change. They will know how to communicate with leaders, as well as with workmates and with customers. The perfect connection with people around will help a lot, no matter on the process of searching aid or struggling for more payment. And most college students will search a part-time job that is connected tightly with their specialized subjects. And no one would miss the chance to apply their knowledge into the processions. And the application means a good review. So instead of having a bad influence on their study, they can improve learning their level easily. There is one important reason for supporting the part-time job that can't be neglected. The lacking of time makes them become a well-organized man. Their schedule is full. So the person will never have a opportunity to drown themselves in computer games. For the three reason above, I strongly support the fact that university students take a part-time job. It's a chance rather than a waste of time. So I encourage all the college students to have a try on the part-time."

However, I don't agree completely ban smoking at all restaurants. First of all, I strongly doubt it can be accomplished. Imagine there are countless restaurants all over the county and countless people eat in them. How can we conduct this order in reality, by force? I don't think it's proper. And most restaurant are not willing to do it for it may drive many customers away. Above all customers are free to smoke, and they deserve the rights to enjoy the rights which doesn't harm others obviously, either. So the communication between waiters and customers who are likely to stick to their own ideas remain to be trouble. Besides, we can't ban a thing just because of its slight harm. Needless to say, the cigarette producing has made up the great shares in GDP. And if we ban smoking in restaurants, the producing must decrease sharply. What's more, as we know, the emissions from cars do great harm to our health, can we ban car driving in the street? Furthermore, it has become a habit to give cigarettes to others to show your respect. It is also a part of table manners. So people may naturally take out cigarettes at meals. Once a tradition is deeply rooted in everyone's heart, the first thing we can do is not to ban it but to improve or change it. So I think we can invent some healthy cigarettes to solve it. Or we can divide the restaurant into several parts, in some of which smoking is allowed. So considering the current situation, I don't think to ban smoking in all restaurants is proper."

Nowadays, more and more people who never smokers are troubled by the problems caused by their lung. How could they do that? Once you breathe the smoke in the air from the smokers, you are equally having smoked. So, banning smoking in restaurants is both good for the environment of the restaurant and the health of the customers. Besides the reason above, smoking is also bad for the smokers, not just his health. If you smoke in a public place, the smoke you make may pollute the air around you, which make others easily notice that you are smoking. If I were one of them, I would immediately keep myself away from you, for the first feeling tells me that you are not a good person and you can but hurt me, because smoking is a bad behavior in most people's opinions.

But what if I am a restaurant owner, especially when I am a school restaurant manager? You know, all the restaurants in Wuhan University do not give permission for people to smoke. But I still see somebody smoking. I would ban the smoking strictly. Now I will give you my reason. A person like me who does not smoke also have a right not to smoke, I mean, second hand smoke. Second hand smoke causes many of the same diseases as direct smoking including lung cancer and respiratory diseases. The famous website Wikipedia list several million words about the bad effect of passive smoking. And according to some experts, the cause of passive smoking is even worse than first hand smoking. What's worse, the smoke causes horrible effect to pregnant woman and little baby. So, considering about our country's future, I am strongly against smoke. Restaurants are places for eating; a satisfaction of your appetite, so at least in some degree eating can substitute with each other. So it is easier to forget smoking, especially for those smoking addicts. So smoking should be banned in restaurants, especially in those school restaurants."

Reasons are as follows. First of all, it does no good for your health. Both the smoker and the second hand smokers are risking their health even their life on the cigarette. Every year, large amounts of people die of lung cancer just because of smoking too much. Everyone should realize that our life is really precious that it our duty to value it. Therefore stay away from the cigar not only for yourself but also for others surrounding you. Secondly, it is a bad behavior or habit for our adolescents to imitate. Smoking in front of others present is a bad manner, which not only make an awful impression on others' mind but mislead the children to regard it as an acceptable or even a cool action. Every adult should be mentally alert to set a good example, especially in the public place. In a word, let's create a smoke free atmosphere to enjoy our meal. Seriously speaking!

At that time we are still children or teenagers, but now, since we entered college we are grown-ups. It is time we should take our responsibilities and sharpening ourselves. Maybe your part-time job is just working as a waiter or a salesman, but the rewards can be a great deal, as long as you're eager to learn and good at reviewing the experience. On the other hands, experienced the rigors of society, you can have a brand-new sight towards your life, and be better prepared for your future. As a saying goes, Book reading is not enough, a better understanding requires practice in person. In my opinion, taking a part-time job is a means of practice; you can regard it as a good chance and draw lessons from it. Just go for it!"

So, having a part time job could be a good choice. And having a part time job also could improve our ability, such as communicate ability, coordinate ability.

First of all, smoking is harm to people's health, not only to these smokers but also nonsmokers. There is a lot of data showing that many diseases are caused by smoking. Like, lung cancer, heart trouble, apoplexy, and so on. What's worse, the harm to the nonsmokers who breath in the smoke is much serious than smokers. Second, there are lots of fire accidents being caused by smoking in recent years. Some smokers throw the stumps away at will. It not only causes great loss, but also destroys the environment. Third, smoking in public places is not civil. It gives others an impression that these people who smoke in public places are selfish and immoral.

But smoking is indeed not a good habit, and it should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking is harmful to smoker's health. Lots of serious diseases would be caused as a result of the bad habit, such as lung cancer. Secondly, smoking at restaurants does make a very bad effect on other customers. Not only does the terrible smell make others feel disgusting, but also the bad smoke may be detrimental to the customers. Thirdly, smokers always make the restaurants very dirty. Other customers may not want to have their dinner in such a terrible environment. Finally, as we know from some news, a great fire may be just caused by a little butt.

Another effect is raising your heart rate, which adds extra stress on your heart. On the other hand, smoking in public affects other people. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the public environment. In restaurants, the air is not well-circulated, smoking leads the air conditions worse. Restaurant is a place for people to have fun, where should have a fresh environment. In public places, such as shopping malls and restaurants, there could be many babies, old people and pregnant women, smoking will make a worse effect to them. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, no matter where he is. It will be beneficial to all of us."
296,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Part-time job is said to be quite simple in some western countries. However, in China where the convention is that students shouldn't be involved in any thing but learning and studying, there is no environment for students to get a part time job. Furthermore, we have to think about why students should do part time job and what can doing part time job bring us, college students. The views of people who support doing part time job is that through doing part time job students can touch the society deeper and feel the invisible rules of adult world in person. Sometimes the income is another reason. Personally, the income can be ignored at most of conventions. When college students go out to do part time job, we can earn no more than 50 per hour. The average is just 20 per hour. Even the truth and our work can slightly impress us the real value of money and make us more grateful, it can not worth our time spending on it. Our college offers us abundant resource and we have no reason to sacrifice our opportunity of using these to do the part time job. In one word, the major mission for student is only studying."
205,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As far as I am concerned, it is important for student to have a part-time job. My points are listed as follows. Firstly, students in the school take classes in the campus everyday, so that they concentrate too much on the books in front of them, leading to a fact that they do not know much about the society, which is by all means not good for them esp when they step into society. Having a part-time job help them to learn to work in a earlier time, to get along with people who have been working for some period of time and so on, all of which give them a closer view to society, which is certainly a kind of good experience for them. Secondly, doing a part-time job make students have different points of views as they should deal with people from all walks of life. This can also gives them different respects to value things. Thirdly, they know better how to earn money and have a deeper understanding of how their parents brought them up, which also let them treasure the present life. So, it is important for student to have a part-time job."
063,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There are many different views in whether college students should have apart-time job because it has many advantages and disadvantages. I think it decides in our own attitude. So I can divide it into three points. The first point is that we can get more social experience and improve the working ability. As the matter of fact, a part-time job like a hard training, it can teach you how to communicate with other people and make money, even though you can't get more money. A part-time job can change your philosophy and it can let you know how difficult in make money. Furthermore, we can gain some money in our part-time job. We can use this money to buy something or pay our daily fee. For instance, if you want to buy something, you don't want to tell your parents, hence you can use this money and you will feel the proud because of you make the money. Thirdly, I think we must find an appropriate part-time job. Although a part-time job can give us many benefits, but we should remember that we are the college students and the study is most important than other things. We should not take much time into part-time job. As a whole, a part-time job has many benefits with college students, but we must control the time so that we can focus on our study."

Imaging that you delivering some advertisement, standing in the store smiling to welcome people or serving people in a restaurant in the hot summer day. I prefer to take a part time job thought feeling tired and facing trouble. As a college student now, I have been able to burden duty in law. Though my family supports me to finish my studying in school, i still want to burden duty of paying partly for the school fees. To the majority of college students, the school fees are too high to pay. If you plan to set, aslo choose a suitable job for yourself. It's obvious that the competition in society is more intense than before. Even other position of a cleaner can attract thousands of graduates. Let alone other jobs with high salary. Higher the salary, higher the standard. What should you do before landing a good job according to a survey about job in Daily China, more than half of the sample prefer to take a part job, for two benefits, firstly, you an acquire a general knowing of particular job and the steps or the strategies to do well. Secondly, you can experience totally different daily life. It can also good your CV. In my opinion, taking a part time job can helps as adjust ourselves to the society and earn some extra money. All in all, don't judge from the salary or your favorite, choose the suitable job depending on your goal and strength."
204,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Is it a good thing for college students to work part-time jobs? I think there are many advantages for college students to have part-time jobs. Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study because of part-time jobs. But in my opinion, students can choose to take up a part-time job according to their own situation. As we know, college students have fewer subjects and less pressure than high school. They have more time to do things they like. Having a part-time job is not a bad idea I think. Taking a part-time job has lots of advantages for college students. Firstly, part-time job offer them opportunities to apply what they have learned in school and demonstrate their abilities. Secondly, students can make some money through the part-time job, and it enables them to be more independent of their family and builds up their self-confidence. Thirdly, part-time experiences may be of great help to their future careers. Finally, part-time jobs can broaden their college lives and help them know more of themselves and society. But the more important thing for them is to keep a good balance between part-time job and their study. On the condition, I agree with the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
150,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Not only men but also women smoke around the world. However, there is one thing that deserves us discussing, if smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country. in my opinion it is a good chose to ban smoking in all restaurants. To start with, restaurants are the places for people to eat food. If you smoke, it will not only pollute the environment but also does harm to other people's health. Because we all know there are many diseases linked with smoking. for example people who smoke are easier to have cancer than others who do not smoke, so smoking in public is not polite even unequal to other person. what's worse, smoking is unsafe. Building a restaurant needs a lot of money, just a cigarette may cause a fire which will destroy the whole restaurant. In a word, as far as I am concerned, it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurants in the country. We can image if there were no smoking in all the restaurants what our environment will become and may be people can live longer than when smoking is not limited in public. Considering all the aspects, banning smoking does brings no harm to anything around us but good."
336,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It's reported that more and more cities ban public smoking. I can't agree it more actually. When we are on a bus, in a supermarket or even in a bar, we would feel disgusted even if only couples of people are smoking. Flating smoke surrounding me always make me cough and hard to breathe, so I really hate people who smoke on public regardless of the others. As a matter of fact, the harm from a public smoker is far more than making people sick. According to many scientific surveys, people near a smoker will smoke second-handly, which does more harm even than the original smokers! So it's never too early too take actions to ban public smoking. Futher more, the poisonous gas can pollute the whole air, which makes our environment worse. And lastly, smoking is a really bad habit itself, so NO PUBLIC SMOKING may help those smokers keep away cigarette to some degree. Sometimes district rules are much more convincing than tender advice, you know. In a word, every minute counts on the way to put NO PUBLIC SMOKING into practice."
337,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I have saw some adults even teens smoking in public places more than once. Actually, I am very against such behavior. As for myself, the smelling of smog makes me feel awful. Besides, there are lots of reasons proving that smoking should be forbidden in public places. First, it is reported that if a smoker is smoking in a room, the health of other people who would breath in the poisonous smog around the smoker will be affected. Meanwhile, when people smoke in the public places, the air of the public places will be polluted. So it is no wonder that some public places have set the smoking room or smoking zone. Even so, smoking in public places shouldn't be promoted. Second, I believe that everyone might know that smoking is bad for our health, but why do so many people cannot stop smoking? Because smoking can addict people easily. Once you have a try, you cannot reject it. So the forbid of smoking in public places is of great importance in the term of the health of civilian people. Third, sometimes many dangerous accidents are caused by smoking. For example, when you are smoking in the gas station, the spark of cigarette may set fire to the gasoline escaping from the fuel tank, and cause big explosion. Considering from people's health or the security of society, the advantages of smoking in public places are much more than the disadvantages. We shall forbidden the smoking in public places for a better future."
298,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As is we all known, smoking does harm to our health. It is so normal to see a man or a woman smoking in public place. I don't know why so many people like to smoke everyday. Even though they clearly know that's a bad habit. They are seriously addicted to it as if they would die without it. Another word we know is smoking is to slowly kill oneself. Why don't we stop the step to the gap of death? But the worst is someone harm themselves' health but also others' when they smoke at some public place, such as the hospital, the airport, the train station and so on. Though there is no one state it is not allowed to smoke at these place, but we should take others' feel into considerate. When you are smoking, do you see the sick babies in the breast of their mums, if you notice people who need fresh air to keep minds functioning well? So next time when we want to light a piece of smoke in our hand up, we had better have a think will I influent others? Can I take the one in my pack and care about myself health? If we do so, I believe the number of people who like smoking in public places will become smaller and smaller."
231,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I do agree with the first statement that college students need to have a part-time job in their spare time. Firstly, by doing a part-time job, we can broaden our horizons, which, to some degree, can also fulfill our life. For example, we can acknowledge some basic skills we need to lead a good life. Second, some college students have gained a lot of experience through the process and they have also benefited much from it when doing their current work. If we meet a similar problem in our work, we can deal with it smoothly by using the method we have used when we do our part-time job. Third, as college life is filled with a lot of activities, taking part in this one is a good choice, which not only helps us get close to society but also gives us a brief image of different people. To sum up, by taking part in such kind of activity, we can know something about the current society and acknowledge some skills, and at the same time, know how to deal with problems in our daily life. I believe that what our college students need most. As a consequence, we should advocate college students to take part-time jobs."
057,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Gone are the days when we had no choice but to remain in the classroom just to study theoretical knowledge. Having entered universities, we have more free time after having class. For a large number of us, it is a good choice to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job is so important for college students and here are some reasons. Firstly, being a university student, we have too much spare time over six hours a day. So what should we put this time into a meaning life? Of course, doing a part-time job is a good choice. Not only we can spare the free time but also we can make many new friends doing the work. Though, there are some difficulties in the work such as time is limited, the working overruns the ability of a college student or even the work takes much time. You feel satisfied after overcoming these. Secondly, doing a part-time job can get lots of experience and you become more plentiful. As we all know, big company care more employees working experience rather than education, so it is necessary to have a part-time job in the college. Besides, having a part-time job will earn extra pocket money for the college students. So the students don't have to ask money from their parents but get it by themselves. Only in this way, can they build the conscious of money and be more mature. In short, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Why not join in this meaningful activity?"
299,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ There is no denying that there are so many people smoking around us. As is known to everyone, there is enormous harm lying in smoking. For instance, smoking can bring severe harm to the smokers' lungs. But the fact is that people still continue to smoke. Almost all of the smokers began to smoke out of curiosity. After a period of time, they got addicted to it. And then, they found it quite difficult to get rid of the habit of smoking even though they had already been aware of the damage brought by smoking. The reason is obvious. They have anaclisis and they can't live without cigarette. Our urgent affair is to find some measures to help the smokers to quit smoking under the circumstance. Firstly, we should try our best to propagandize the harm to smokers and people around brought by smoking. In this way, we can help them build their determination and confidence of abandoning smoking successfully. And then, we can supervise and urge our family members. My father had ever been addicted to smoking. It's my mother, my sisters and me that urged him to quit smoking every day. The result was perfect. Now my father will never have a smoke. Lastly, we can find some succedaneum for them so that they can quit smoking more easily."
056,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ After graduate from high school, we are already 19 years old. It is time for us to lead our own life. So many students find a job to experience our lives. And it has become common. But is it important for college students to have a part-time job? In my opinion, it is of significance. Although it is a truth that for a college student, his most important goal must be to learn well and to get a high score in examinations, but it is also important to experience our lives. As a student, if study is you everything you may lose a lot of fun in our colorful life. In addition, the reason why we learn theoretical knowledge is to apply them to practice. So apart-time job is a chance for us to use the knowledge. To a student's life, part-time work can broaden his social experience. He will have the precious opportunity to meet people from different areas and will face a variety of problems. Furthermore, work helps a student to develop greater independence, and earning his own pocket money can teach him how to handle his finances. Finally, a part-time job can help a student to develop a greater sense of responsibility and team-work spirit. In one word, I believe that most students would benefit from taking a part-time job while they are at college."
164,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking should be completely banned in restaurants not only for the health of other people, but also for the atmosphere. Many people think that smoking is an exciting way to rest them. Some people think smoking can make them be a handsome person, especially the young. But some people smoking just because their friends' influence. They smoke everywhere, not caring other people. As we all know, smoking can hurt our health, both body and mind. If a person is sitting with a smoking person, he will be more dangerous than the smoker. Restaurants are public places, many people get together here, talking, singing, eating and doing other things. They will be very happy without any pollution. However, if a person is smoking, they may be dangerous because of smelling the smoke, and they cannot eat quite well for they cannot smell the smoking. They may be not able to eat anything, and then they would go. Thus, smoking may broke a harmony atmosphere. In a word, smoking should be completely banned in restaurants; it hurt the smoker as well as others. For the purpose of protecting the health of people, especially the people in public places, smoking should be banned."
302,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, smoking does great harm to not only smokers but also other people around and the environment. So some people advised that we should ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country, with which I don't agree. Below are the reasons: First, the amount of smoker in our country is an extremely large number. Obviously, it's impracticable to let everyone of them give up smoking. When these people go to restaurants, they will feel so bad if there is no room for them to smoke, which is a little unkindness. Secondly, a restaurant is a place where people eat food as well as relax. To some people, it is smoking that let them calm down and relax. And the number of these people may be very large. If they can't do what they think is relaxing, they may choose not to go there, and thus the restaurants' business can be badly influenced. At last, we can set up some special smoking room for smokers in restaurants so they don't disturb other people. This solution can solve many problems that smoking may bring. We can find that it can keep balance between smokers and others, so banning smoking is not a must. Banning smoking is a meaningful but hard work. We should take account for many practical factors in the process. So, smoking shouldn't be completely banned now. I believe we can find a good way to solve these smoking problems and reduce the amount of smokers."
165,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As our society develops, more and more people are tending to smoke to relax and show their taste and status. But I think it is wrong to smoke in a restaurant. So we should try to ban smoking in the restaurants. Firstly, smoking does harm to people's bodies. Many cancers are caused by smoking. In the same time, it also does harm to the second smokers. People who do not smoke but smell the smoke are inflected as well. For your health and others' please stop smoking. Secondly, smoking can produce bad smoke and it will pollute the air in the restaurant. Restaurant is a place for people to eat and relax. No one would be willingly to sit in a smoke-full place. And smokers also could not enjoy their meals as well. At last, it is impolite to smoke in the public space like restaurant. Smoking not only costs money and time also the image of a person. Not smoking in a restaurant shows your respect to other consumers. We can see a person's virtue of patience from his behavior. A good person will not smoke in a restaurant. Although we cannot ignore the advantages of smoking like relax and joy we should forbid smoking in restaurants."
339,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs, which is criticised by many people for affecting academic study to some degree. Despite the disadvantage, I still hold the view that college students benefit a lot more from this experience. To begin with, taking a part-job helps college students make their first step into the real society. Every one ought to work for the society sooner or later. Early education equips us with primary knowledge while colleges act as a transition period, transforming us from students to social individuals. It's an appropriate and efficient way to aware us of the society and realize the transition. Besides, getting a job early helps us find what we really like. Look at Dell, one of the most successful businessmen in the world. He took up fixing computers during college, resulting in his leaving school and starting his own career. Jobs are what we are going to devote our whole lifetime to. Therefore, we should get prepared so as to choose one we are crazy about. In addition, working experience during college time adds to the possibility of being successfully signed by a prominent corporation. Take my sister as an example. With ample working experience in college, she was picked out from a pile of talented employees. When competing on the fierce employment battle, part-time job experience is a powerful weapon. Opponents say that having a part-time job may have a bad impact on one's academic grades. However, grade is not the single standard by which a person should be judged. It is the all-round quality that really counts. To conclude, I stand at the back of getting a part-time job during college. It is interesting, beneficial and worthwhile."
338,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ It is known to all that, in China, the man who can get a career must be 18 years old already. The age we get to university. So, can a college student do a part-time job while studying? I believe that it is necessary. On the one hand, Chinese students are poor in social experience. When compared with other students, like American students, we always get higher grades in test, but do really bad when we both work in the same job. That's to say, Chinese students cannot make learning into using. The solution I think might be getting a part-time job. In this way, not only do we get social experience, but also making some profits, and experiencing the life we outer to live in when we graduated. On the other hand, getting a part-time job is not getting a real job. As part-time jobs are costing our rest time, not the studying time, we could do a good part-time job together with learning well. Of course, part-time job must affect our daily study. But the affection can be positive. It makes us to use time more carefully that the job sometimes will replace doing homework on weekend. There are many famous people who live in poor family studied in college with one or more part-time jobs. And they were success, like LincoIn. As a conclusion, I agree on having a part-time job when we study in college. But everyone must put it in mind that we are students not workers, so studying is always the most significant thing in our life!"
185,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿People always have different ideas even on a easy thing. On this point, some people have the idea that college students have to join a part-time job while other people disagree. Form my perspective, I agree with the former. The reasons are simple. First of all, the course of finding a part-time job is a challenge for these students. They will never imagine how difficult finding a job is before you really find one. You will feel tremendous pressure in the job market at the same time. It can give you some help about how to persevere your determination of finding a job. Secondly, we can acquire some knowledge that will not exist in our classes. Some theories your teachers' deliver to you which you can put into practice are the knowledge you really obtain. Besides, on the one hand, a part-time job is not a heavy work and it will not take you a lot of time. On the other hand, you can earn extra pocket money. Well, in that case, why not?However, there are not always just some benefits. College students sometimes engage themselves into deceits because they are inexperienced in finding a job. But that's not all, some college students even take a part-time job as a reason for not concentrate on learning knowledge. In a word, we should have a proper attitude toward a part-time job."
279,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is not rare to see college students taking part-time jobs nowadays. Obviously, as the independence of college students becomes more and more important, part-time job are turning essential. So despite its certain drawbacks and defects, I do strongly agree that college student should have a part-time job. My reasons will be discussed further in the following paragraphs. First of all, from a personal and psychological perspective, it is widely acknowledged that doing part-time jobs will do help to the development of college students. College experience is undoubtedly a treasure of our whole life, but beside academic achievement, we should also pursue the developments of our social ability. Taken one of my own experience for instance. Although I am just a freshman in college, I got a part-time job as a tutor last semester. While working as a tutor of a high school student, I realized that teaching some one also means being responsible for him. It is not the income but the experience itself that drove me along the way. Through this part-time job, I sensed that my communicating skill and the ability to manage my schedule has reached a high standard. So it is important for us college students to have a part-time job. It might also be noted that getting a part-time job is more economic for college students. When we entered university, it does not only another period of education but also means that we are grown-ups who should at least, be partially independent on economy. Since we still have to perfect our knowledge our skills that will be useful in the future, it is quite impossible for us to get a full time job. Due to what mentioned, I think part-time job is a suitable choice. In a word, although doing part-time jobs will take up students' time, its advantages on further development and economic independence can not be neglected. So I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
243,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As is known to all that smoking does a lot of harms to our health. Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? It remains to be discussed. In my opinion, smoking can't be banned at all restaurants. First and foremost, smoking is a long-overdue question which is undoubtedly can't be solved in a short period of time. It is estimated that there thousands of people who are hooked on cigarette and the number becomes larger every year. If we ban smoking in all restaurants, these smokers can not dine out any more. What's more, we can't promise that these people will all quit smoke. Maybe they will get mad, maybe their family will broke for their not dining out with their family members. Lots of problems which we didn't expect will exist. Society will be in a mass. Last but not the least, it is not the only way to protect most people's health. Restaurants can set smoking region for people who smoke and it will meet all guests' demand. At large, Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country for it is not a necessity and will bring unexpected problems."
025,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It has been a hot topic for a long time whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people take it for granted that smoking should be banned, while there are still others who disagree with it. As for me, my favor goes to the former opinion. I have some reasons described in the following. As we all know, smoking is very harmful to our health. What is more, smoke can cause all kinds of disease that it may make a man die. For example, there are a great many of people die of smoking every year. This is the result of smoking. Another reason t for smoking should be banned, especially at the public place, such as restaurants, hospitals, and so on. And it is clear that restaurant is a place we have lunch. If someone next to you always smoke when you eating food, you probably cannot start it., leaving the lunch and wanting to go. As stated above, what should we do? There is no doubt that we should exert all ours energy to ban smoke at all the restaurants in the country. Now, let us start and make progress together!"
395,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It has become a common phenomenon that doing part-time jobs nowadays has become one of the major parts of our college life. College students some do part-time jobs to make extra pennies and others only fulfill their life. As far as I am concerned, doing part-time jobs plays an important role in our college life. Firstly, part-time jobs greatly teach us to be thankful owing to the fact that it is the first time in our life to earn on our own even though it is usually poorly-paid. We can never know how hard our parents have been going through to raise us up unless we come to earn our life on our own. It all bothers us whether the child we teach follows our instructions or whether the customers in the restaurants we serve are really satisfied with us. We learn to force ourselves to meet social demands, which is what our parents have been doing during the last twenty years. Therefore, after we finish our part-time jobs, it is definitely necessary to ring our parents to express our gratitude. In the second place, due to the high tuition in colleges today, doing part-time jobs really helps the students' family to relieve this heavy burden. And to those who do not have much allowance in colleges, many hardly make ends meet almost every month. Thus, an extra pay will be quite helpful. Last but not the least, students can get connected to the outside world by doing part-time jobs. Problems like the discussion on the salary, the tough employer, all provide us with a rare opportunity to handle everything by ourselves. We were all well taken care of before going to the college and by doing part-time jobs we learn to get a solution independently and face the society on our own. In a nutshell, doing part-time jobs is absolutely vital in our college life and it is beneficial that every student tries to obtain this experience."
069,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, more and more college students have a part-time job in their free time. The phenomenon causes intense debate among people. Some people think it not good. Some other people think it is important. I agree with the idea that it is good for college student to have part-time jobs. I have some reasons to support my opinion. A part-time job has a lot of advantages. Not only can you make money by doing part-time job, but also improve your particular skill. It can lighten family burden. You can buy thing you like too. Also, you can get a lot of experience about work and communication that are very useful in the future if you find a job. Many students have a part-time job get a lot of experience form it and they find a good job later. However, it also has negative effect on students. Although it can make money and improve abilities, it also takes your much time away so that the time you spent in studying would be less. From my perspective, having a part-time job is a good way for students to improve themselves. But you should get a balance between study and a part-time job."
068,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Personally speaking, I think it's of great value for college student to have a part-time job but I don't believe that it's necessary for them to work. On one hand, that college students have plenty of time is well known for us. So, firstly I suppose that they are ought to take advantage of their time and show their value in society while earn their own disposable money. Secondly, I'm in favor of the idea that a excellent college student must be able to balance their time in school and in society, therofore, I think take part-time can show one's ability in time management and give students knowledge on all sides. Thirdly, as we all know, the experiences of taking part-time jobs, especially in some big companies, can add color to college students' CV and help them to find a better job after graduation. On the other hand, I don't speak up for that every college students must go and find part-time jobs. First, some of them just enjoy the life with the surrounding of books, teachers, etc. they don't mind being nerds. Moreover, in fact, students who study in majors such as pscology, history are not easy to find a job, thus, they are supposed to devote more to doing research or studying rather than hunting part-time jobs. Also, good grade in a particular field is important too, which equals to the so-called experiences. All in all, college students may gain a lot from these kinds of precious experiences of part-time jobs, but we shouldn't attach to much importance to these."
052,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿When I was a small child, I felt curious about why my father like smoking so much. I still remember that my father told me that the cigarettes are to them what the snacks are to us. Sometimes our lives need this kind of eating things to have entertainment. According to this, I hold the opinion that we can't ban the smoking in the restaurant. Indeed, smoking in public sometimes will disturb others and make the air dirty; the restaurant can avoid this by preparing non-smoking area for people to have a cigarette. By doing this, it can easily solve this problem. Although, may some people would say there's no benefit to smoke but harm people's health. Living in a sociable society, you need to know the basic behaviors of how to communicate with others in business or something else. The cigarettes as a tool contribute more on the process. Of course it's hard to avoid having cigarettes in a restaurant. Finally I also want to emphasis that people should smoke in a suitable way. After all health is the most important thing in your life. Not smoke too much for the sake of your health. I am not appreciating the opinion that we should ban the smoking in the restaurant. Instead, I would prefer having a smoking area."

They think it is so good a rule that must do great good to human health. But the people who smokes feels unpleasant very much. It is so inconvenient for me, when I arrived station I used to have a cigarette to keep myself awake, but now I am forbidden to do It. a smoker said. As far as I am concerned, I don't think it is right to completely forbidden smoking in public places. Though smoking will do damage to our health, we should deal with it properly. Knowing the disadvantage, there are still many people smoking. They do it with all kinds of purposes such as to keep awake, to remit pressure. We all know that caffeine contained in tea and coffee also have bad influence on health. We can accept that people drink tea and coffee, why can't we accept people smoking. What I said may be farfetched, but we should respect others' hobby. Many people may say we do it just because we want to protect others from bad influence. I think it is their excuse. Just what we did, we can make smoking room in the public places. We should respect others' hobby, even it is not healthy. We can persuade them to get out of the hobby, but we have no right to prevent them from it as long as it is legal."

Smoking may let eaters who don't take cigarette choke. Let alone its harm to their bodies. So I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. And the reasons why smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants may be listed as followings. To begin with, smoking can disturb the harmonious atmosphere. Imagine, in some high-level restaurant, some people are happily enjoying their dinners. Suddenly they smell the fog of smokers from nearby, they will immediately feel uncomfortable and cover their nose and mouth. Sometimes, if there are babies sit close to smokers, it is more terrible. Now let's come to its harm. Regarding the adults, children or teenagers have to tolerate second-hand smoking. Many people already know that second-hand smoking is more harmful that smoking. Let alone to the children. And many restaurants are often filled with the young, so it is necessary to ban smoking in the restaurants for young people health. To sum up, it is harmful for consumers in the restaurants to suffer second-hand smoking. And smoking in the restaurants should be banned without any doubts."
307,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Recently, the topic on part-time job has been brought into focus and the voices from different people vary from each other. Some reckon that part-time job is necessary for college students while other people consider not. To my mind, part-time job is of great necessity though it may bring some inconvenience and clashes. To begin with, I think, part-time job can enrich our daily life. Since we have courses in weekdays, spending the weekends in doing part-time job instead of wasting time should be appreciated. Moreover, as is known to us all, college students should maintain some work experience, to some degree, and doing part-time job is a pretty fancy way to enrich students' work experience. Thirdly, we can get some extra money just by doing part-time jobs, which gives us both the happiness of striving and the hardship of working. In other words, we can not only get money but also gain the mental fortune. On the other side, however, the part-time job may cost us some time but we should not throw away a superb rose just because of its prickles. So at last I emphasize that part-time job is very necessary for college students."
161,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I think a part-time job for the college students is very important. It is benefit for us in every aspect. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, part-time job can help them to solve money problem, especially those coming from poor families. It also can lighten the burden of their parents. Many students from poor families cannot afford college fees, and our bank system fail to loan college students as effectively as it does in developed countries, so taking part-time jobs becomes a way for them to meet their great expenses in campus lives. Secondly, part-time jobs will offer us a chance to demonstrate our ability and make us more independent. Of course it can improve the ability of our communication and enrich our social experience. We may get some useful information during the process of looking for a job. You know, many companies tend to employ the one who has working experience. Because they have better quality to solve problems than other. Moreover, we can put what we have learned in class to practice, and share the experience with our classmates. We cannot learn all kinds of skills in the university, so we'd better find a part-time job to enrich our mind and broaden our field of vision. In a word, we will benefit a lot from part-time jobs."
020,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is a hot topic for college students to argue whether it is important to have a part-time job. Different people have different view. Some students advocate the idea. For one reason as result, college students should responsible for ourselves, and part-time job can provide us the opportunity to make money, so that we can not to ask parents for our allowances. And it can also relief the pressure of parents. For another, through part-time job we can gain a lot of experience. Besides, it will good for us to prepare our future job. As the competition is fiercer in the social life, the more experience you have, the more chance you will have. However, the others are against the idea, they hold that as a student, we should focus our attention on study. It will spend much of our time and energy to do the part-time job. Because as part-time worker, our life and property security is not well protected by the law. For my own perspective, as we enter the university we have more free time, it is important for you to choose how to use of them. We should make the most of time and be the master of it. From my own experience, I am working in the restaurant in my free time, and I feel happy to have the job."
246,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. My reasons for that are as follows. First of all, the most important thing for college students is studying rather than working. We paid fees which is not so low to come to college on purpose of learning knowledge and building ourselves instead of making money. college is a best(maybe the last) place for people to study. We can read books, communicate with teachers and students freely and do a lot of research we want to. That is the original and real purpose that I choose to go to college. On the other hand, I believe we can learn more about work after we graduate from college and have a full-time job. what benefits can part-jobs bring to us?Most part-time jobs are easy work that even a junior can do. So I think it is a waste of time to do part-jobs that can offer you nothing but few salary. On the contrary, I think we should seize days to learn more. As the saying goes, Time is Money. I think it is more reasonable to use the time we now have to exchange for the money of future. From what has been mentioned above, we can draw a conclusion that part-time job is not important for college students at all."
088,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As we all known, the argument against smoking become normal. Nowadays smoking has been shown to be dangerous to our health, living environment as well as our life quality. From the survey about smoking in 2002, it's said that the number of smoker in China reached 13 hundred million, which took up a large number of the population. What's more, recent research has shown that non-smokers can 30 percent of smokers all over the world, suffer health problem if they spend long period of time with people who do smoke. So, people who smoke in the restaurants will do harm to people who are non-smokers around them. Those non-smokers all hate it. However, smoking undoubtedly helps many people to relax, especially when they are relaxing with friends in the restaurant. Though smoking does lots of harm, somebody would also argue that people should have the right to choose whether they smoke or not. In my opinion, people should not smoke in a room where there are non-smoker but surely they should be free to smoke where it is suitable. I suggest that public place like restaurant should seta special room for smoker to enjoy their ""bad habits at will."
113,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Have you ever found that: when you have a dinner at a restaurant, you may see someone is smoking as if there are no other people around them? It is a common phenomenon in our society. And the question is that: shall we ban smoking at all the restaurant in the country?As for me, I don't think banning smoking in all restaurants is a good idea. We should give the right to the restaurant itself to make the decision. To begin with, banning smoking may hurt the restaurant's profit. If the restaurant bans smoking, it would make some customer who has a habit of smoking away from the restaurant, which will reduce its income. For some restaurants, if they have the single room for the customer, they can permit them smoke but not affect others. Then, this policy may influence people who have a habit of smoking. If all the restaurants ban smoking in the country, where can they have dinner? Absolutely, this will annoy many people. Last but not the least, I think it is not a feasible way to make this policy. The country is so large that we cannot make it practical to all of the restaurants. In general, I suggest that some of the restaurant should ban smoking; however, the other can permit smoking in the restaurant."
112,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nobody will deny that smoking is a scissors that cutting down the lives of the smokers as well as the smoke inhalers. In nowadays, many countries have carried out some measures to ban smoking in the public areas to reduce the harm of smoking to the least. But in our country, smoking still can be seen everywhere. I think some measures must be taken to diminish or ban smoking in some particular places like restaurants. There are some kinds of public areas in China gathering the most people like gardens, public squares, restaurants, etc. Different from the open areas of garden or square, the room of restaurants is closed and that makes air not circulate as easily as that in the outside. So smoke will linger in the room as long as possible, making the atmosphere inside bad for everyone in the room, especially for the children and the pregnant women. It has been claimed by the scientists that the passive smoke inhalers gain more harm to their health than the smokers themselves. So the restaurants have been becoming dangerous places for the passive smokers if smoking can't be banned there. It's time for the government to do something to clear up the atmosphere in the restaurants."
128,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As for part-time jobs, from my opinion of view, it's important for college students to have one. As we can see, when we stepped into the gate of the college, our aim is not simply to get good grades just like the goals which we set up in the senior school. What we should consider is all the abilities and qualities we need to have so that we can stand in the complex society. And it's a very useful way to improve those aspects for college students to have a part-time job. There are many advantages to have a part-time job. First of all, it can help to improve ourselves a lot. We can learn much more things than the boring knowledge given by the textbooks, and these things are more valuable for us to adjust to the real world we live in. What's more, we have to communicate with others while we work for the job. At that time, we can strengthen our capabilities about how to talk to others in suitable ways. Also, we can truly take part in the various social activities and have a better understanding of the life. It can assist us to foster better personalities, too. Then, having a part-time job will benefit the family. A college student's cost is very expensive and it's a big burden for the majority families. If the students can work for themselves, it will decrease the pressure which we put on the shoulders of our parents. However, though it's important for college students to have a part-time job, it must be on the basis of the ability that you can study well, and we mustn't let us fall behind others because of it. Above all, it will make a great sense for the college students to have a part-time job."
181,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Because of the extend to which smoking do a great harm to individuals' health of physical as well as mental aspects, people have taken a great deal of methods to ban smoking. Recently the actions are being taken in restaurants all over the country. However, there are still lots of problems when the smoking is completely banned in the restaurant. some people argue that this policy is not considerate to those who have been addictive to smoking. And the owners of restaurants also grumbled that because of the demure banning of smoking, they have lost some regular consumers who have been conducive to smoking. From my perspective, I don't think it is quite inhumane to banned smoking completely in restaurants for the simple reason that smoking does too much harm to people's health, such as heart disease, cancer, and so forth, nowadays even on the covers of cigarettes, there are also the alarming words: quit smoking which will do harm to your health. so I think now that we are determined to ban smoking to make contribution to our health, we should ban it thoroughly and completely. Even in restaurants or other public places. To cut it into a nutshell, smoking should be banned completely in all the restaurants around the world, only by doing this can we make the meet ends."
129,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿We have been college students. It seems that we are more relaxed than high school students because we have fewer lessons and we are more relaxed than people who have worked because we don't have to earn much money to support ourselves and our family. However, we are not relaxed as it seems to be. In fact, it is important for us to have a part-time job. Firstly, we indeed have more spare time than others. After class, we have a lot of time to learn by ourselves. But most of us spend much time in playing computer games or walking streets with no mind. It is better to find a part-time job during this time. Secondly, considering we need to gain social experiences before graduation and college life can't offer us many chances, we can do a part-time job to improve our social abilities. Thirdly, we can earn some money to reduce our parents' burden. Though most of parents ask us not to worry about the expenses in college, as a college student, we are old enough to do so and we are responsible to support ourselves even our parents. In addition, some students may come up with an idea of their future job. For example, many successful businessmen had their company when they were college students. As a college student, we should have a sense of responsibility for ourselves, our family and the society. We want a part-time job and it will benefit us."
179,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Recently the result of a survey has shown that the majority of Chinese think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants nationwide. Obviously, people always will not make an agreement on the same issue. Some others consider it very terrible to allow people to smoke in restaurants. For me, I am in favor of the former opinion. The followings are my reasons for my points of view. Firstly, as we all know, smoking harms people' heath, especially there are so many people in the restaurant, which includes children there. Secondly, with the rising income, more people would like to restaurant to have their dinners or enjoy the time with their friends. So most of people hope that the environment of the restaurant is more comfortable rather than dirty. Besides, some people think that smoking can make him relax when he is in trouble. In fact, only if they have a good motion, everything will be fine. Last but not least, if a person smoke in public, I believe that most people don't like him,. Because he doesn't take care of others' feeling, the kind of people is not popular among people. Of course I don't mean that we cannot smoke in all public places. After all, smoking also brings some advantages. To put it in a nutshell, I insist that don't disturb others when you smoke."
178,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with the point that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I have the following reasons to support my view. Nowadays, some governments have completely banned smoking at all the restaurants. This is a good idea for people don't smoke though it is unfair to smokers. As far as I am concerned, I think this is a good rule. Firstly, smoking which leads to some diseases like lung cancer is harmful to our health. What is the worse, many people around the world died because of smoking. Besides, it is not surprising that smoking will pollute the environment by giving poisonous gas off into the air. When people smoke in the restaurants, of course, the air in the restaurants will be polluted by the cigarette smoke. Other people will feel very uncomfortable to eat there. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurants can increase waiters' working efficiency. Smokers won't interrupt their work all the time to smoke. What is more, some people who are allergic to smoking in the restaurants cannot bear with the gas, which makes them sicker. Smokers think it is unfair for them but smokers can smoke outside of the restaurants when they really want to smoke in the restaurants. So from all the disadvantages of smoking and good points of banning smoking in the restaurant, we should ban it from now on in the restaurants."
285,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As smoking is such a harmful and selfish habit that I think it should be totally banned in public places. Smoking is harmful not only to the smokers, but also to people around them. If someone smokes in the public places, such as restaurants, or underground station, everyone around him will be forced to take in the second-hand smoke. According to the research, second-hand smoke is even worse than smoke. Even a single person smokes in public places, all the people around him will be harmed by cigarettes. Smoking also will ruin people's appetite and mood. Imagine someone is smoking while you are having delicious food. How unpleasant could it be! It's such a selfish behavior because the smoking person may feel good but people around him will be very uncomfortable. Further more, not smoking in the public places can also show people's respect because nobody will feel good if someone is smoking while talking to him, or even being around him. In my opinion, not smoking should be a kind of social manner. Smoking in the public is a bad habit that should be discouraged. If no one is smoking in the public places, then the air will be fresher, food will be more delicious, and people will be more friendly."
284,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with the suggestion that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. Smoking is so bad a habit that it harms not only smokers themselves, but also people who are close to them. So besides restaurants, all other public places should also ban smoking. Smoking does a lot of harm to people. As we all know, cigarettes have many poisonous chemicals that are harmful for our lungs. Scientists have had an experiment that found smokers' lungs are worse than people who don't smoke, and smokers live much shorter. Besides, the gas cigarettes release is more harmful which have a bad influence on the environment around smokers. Besides, smoking can cause fire accident. when people have smoked a cigarette they may put it anywhere without care of papers or dry leaves nearby which can cause fire accident. Although the possibility is small, the great number times will make it big. Also, smoking has a bad influence on teenagers. In many films and TV shows, smoking is always related with violence which make teenagers think that smoking means strength. In this way, many depressed boys and girls begin smoking and that make them more fallen than ever. So, in my opinion, smoking is such a bad habit that we must ban it as soon as possible. We should hold a clear brain at any time that smoking can do nothing but damage to us. When we feel unhappy, keep away from cigarettes and do something more interesting such as sports. Let's keep this in mind: cherish families and refuse smoking."
070,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There is no doubt that the restaurant is one of the most popular public places where smokers are used to smoke. We can notice that most of our Chinese restaurants have smoking smell. Smokers may not mention it, but people who don't smoke think it is disgusting and have no appetite for eating. Allowing for this, I partly support that smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in the country. Many reasons could support it. When we are eating, the smoking can easily get into our lungs through our mouths. It is harmful for our lungs. That is to say people who do not smoke can be affected too. That is the reason why we always say smokers also destroy others' lungs when they are smoking. There are still some important reasons. When adults are smoking in restaurants, children would remember this act and imitate it. That means the restaurant is also a place where grows the population of smokers. On the other hand, smokers smoke after meal could damage their digest system and other organs. In summary, smoking is bad for our health, especially during or after meal. I think the government had better to ban smoking at all the restaurants."
142,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Some people are asking this question: is it important for students to have a part-time job? I agree with the idea. I have the following reasons below. After graduating from high school, students who admitted by college have many spare time so that they don't know how to make their lives colorful. Therefore, taking a part-time job is a proper way. They can do something more interesting and meet more people. Most students are isolated from society before. What they should do is study. Though this institution is not acceptable, we have no choice. So taking a part-time job is the proper way to know something about the society we are living in. Then we can learn more knowledge about the real society when we graduate. On the other hand, it is also a way to earn some pocket money we used to getting from our parents. Decreasing parents'burden is every college students should make efforts to do, since we are not earning money now. Above all, from my perspective, taking a part-time job is very important for college students; it not only can make our lives more colorful but also can know something about society."
143,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Most of Chinese families have only one child now. Children born in these families are the very person who are cared for the whole families. Now they are college students, and have part time job is a good tool to make them independent. And it's really important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, having a part-time job make college students realize the cruelty of the world. College is a ivory tower, and it's a innocent environment. If a student hasn't had a part-time job, he or she may can't understand some rules in the some companies, and they may try to get used to it for a long time. In the second place, having a part-time job can make students know that earn money isn't a easy thing to do. In that result, they won't waste money and they will cherish their relationship between then and their parents, because they have realized their parents work hard only want to afford them a comfortable life. Last but not the least, taking a part-time job can take off a part of the burden of some families. Some colleges, especially private colleges, have a high tuition. Colleges students who take part-time jobs can lose the burden of the whole families. In a word, it's really important for students to have a part-time job, because there are many benefits to take part-time jobs. College students should experience it, or they will regret they lose the chance to get realization to this colorful society when they are young."
003,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, some college students have part-time jobs to support their life in college, and other students spend their parents' money to live their life. Many times it's hard for us to say who is right or who is wrong. But in social opinion, also in my opinion, it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. Firstly, having part-time jobs to support college students' life in college can reduce their parents' financial burden. Our parents are no longer giving money to us or give less money to us. It can save the whole family's expenses. Secondly, having part-time jobs can develop our ability. If we have a part-time job, we will know the society or interpersonal relationship better, and we may make friends with more people. It's useful for our future work. In other words we can prepare for our future. In a word, working opens our eyes. Finally, using the money that earned by ourselves, will make us feel great. We all know that food made by ourselves tastes more delicious, the house built by ourselves live more comfortable. As the same way, the money earned by ourselves spends more fulfilling. No matter you live in a poor family or rich family or well-off family, having part-time jobs can help you in many ways. So it is important for college students to have part-time jobs."
265,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As the developing of the society and the increasing of the number of the high school students, more and more high school students begin to take a part time job. Many people think students shouldn't take part time job. But in my opinion, part time job is necessary. There are many high school students whose families are below the poverty line. Their parents can't pay their school fee. If they don't take part time job, they can't go to college. So part time job is necessary for them. Not only money can part time job provide, but also can provide much experience which we can't learn in classroom. Now in our society, many college students can only study. They even don't know how to live. Part time job is right for them to get the experience to live and to work. Taking part time job can also let us know how hard that our parents bring up us. And let us more respect our parents. Taking part time job can lighten our parents' burden, can provide us with much experience and also can let us more respect our parents. So I think part time job is necessary."
264,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Having part-time jobs is a common phenomenon among college students nowadays. In my opinion, doing part-time jobs is a good way to live a meaningful life in the university. Doing part-time jobs can help us adapt to society earlier and lay the foundation of working after graduation. Besides, we can gain working experience and reduce the finance burden of our parents. We may strengthen our sense of responsibility and be stronger in the face of setbacks and know how to handle interpersonal relationships. There are also other benefits, such as improving social skills and our own quality and enrich our lives. Although it's meaningful for us to do part-time jobs, we cannot find part-time jobs blindly. When we find a part-time job, we need to take the time and our own interest into account. We should clearly recognize that we are still students now even though we have become adults. So we must do part-time jobs under the premise of ensuring our studies. Whether to find a part-time job and the number of jobs depend on our own situation. If you have enough time, doing part-time jobs is surely a better choice than playing computer games. If you have a part-time job, cherish the opportunity and enjoy yourself, you will benefit from it a lot."

Now we can see everywhere that student take part –jobs like private teacher, seller and so on. So why they do these jobs? What advantages benefit us? I think the main reason is money. With the improvement of our living standards, a lot of study material are expensive than before. Then the student has to do some jobs to reduce considerable financial pressure. By doing so, we can also have the ability to travel or buy some items we like. We also hope that through this way, we can no longer dependent on our parents. In addition, we can also accumulate some social experience. From kindergarten to high school, what we learned is totally the knowledge from books. In this way, it does a lot benefits to our future jobs. In a word, there are many advantages for our college students to do some jobs. Not only make money, but also develop our independence. So if you a lot of free time after class, try to look for a part-time job and you will not regret about it."

Parents and the public are concerned with college students' development. A great many people start to pay more attention on part-time job. Some people hold the view that part-time jobs will affect students' study in college. In my opinion, a part-time job can help a lot. First of all, knowledge should be put into proactive. Through a part-time job, we can better understand what we have learned in college. Also, we can gain much more than what we have learned from books. Moreover a part-time job is a bridge which connects the college period and the career period after graduation. Some students will feel to have no direction when they graduate of they have never had part-time jobs in college. Since fierce competition is waiting for them, they have little time to adjust to the new environment. IT is not easy for then to learn how companies and working. Yet, if they once had part-time jobs. They will better get involved in the jobs they do. Last but not least, a part-time job can help one build up social relationship and will make one feel more confident. The modern society needs talents that develop in all directions. What we learn from textbooks is far less than enough. A part-time job will make up our disadvantages effectively."
130,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As we all know, nowadays smoking is banned at some restaurants in the country so that those smokers are no longer allowed to smoke in these public places. In my opinion, smoking is not a healthy behavior. And this new rule is good because that banning smoking improve people' health. Smoking can lead to many diseases such as lung cancer. What is worst, when those smokers are able to smoke in these public places, they can also make others sick. But others just could not force smokers to stop smoking until smokers realize their behavior will bring harm to others. However, there are few smokers pay attention to it. Therefore; it is unfair to those nonsmokers to get sick. When banning smoking in public buildings, it will please those nonsmokers. And now with this new rule, smokers have few opportunities to smoke so that it will also improve their health. Also, less smoking in public can do good to our environment. In public places, the harm of smoking is greater. This is connected with another effect of smoking. That is, smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off into the air. However, those smokers say that it takes away some of their right and freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If someone wants to smoke, there are also some private places allowed. Therefore, smokers will choose to smoke in private, not in the public places. In fact, smokers still have their freedom of smoking. In a word, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us."
131,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is no doubt that smoking is harmful to health, but in terms of banning completely at all restaurants in the country, that would arise a fierce dispute in the issue. Smokers would say they feel better after smoke in spirit. It is true that smoking improve one's spirit. But, the improving bases on hurting others' interests, meanwhile it do harm to themselves too. Smoke consists of a lot of harmful gas, including Tar, Nicotine and Carbon monoxide. Smoking in restaurants will contaminate the air. People in the restaurant will sure suffer from second-hand smoke which will do much more harm to them. Too much smoking in the restaurant, the smoke will be to remain in the rooms for a long time. Just use your imagine, you cannot use your meals and have a good rest just because of the remain smoke, that is a thing which can drive you mad. It should be banned because the percentage of non-smokers is higher than active smokers so non-smokers have right to clean air and stop smokers from smoking in the restaurants. What's more, it offend against the law to smoke in public places including restaurants. So, for a better environment, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country."

I think this idea is worthy to consideration, and the starting point of the college students is good. But I don't think that it is necessary to have a part-time job for the college students, because college students have a variety of knowledge to learn. For example, we have several professional classes. Besides, we should take some elective classes. All these require us to try our best to learn them well, they would help us a lot in the future and they are really important. If you want to participate in activities, you can join associations or attend all kinds of competition which school provides. Here you could exercise your capacity. Above-mentioned are what we college students should do. Part-time job waste both time and energy, it may delay our college study. One of my friends always wants to have a part-time job, and she actually finds some. Beacause of that, she has less time to study, and of course her score is low. So it is important to study more and work less. What we should do in the college is enduring learning."
090,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Though we always emphasize the point that study must come first, it doesn't mean that we cannot have part time job. On the contrary, part time job means a lot to our college students. Now I will list some evidence to prove my argument. First, it is widely known that college is the place where we not only gain new knowledge and skills but also design a winning career plan. Part time job give us a chance to set foot into the outside world and to know more about our society. By comparing our dream with the reality, we can alter our aims in time and avoid many foolish mistakes. Then, given the fact that the competition is getting fiercer and fiercer, today, we have to make all efforts to perfect ourselves. Knowledge alone can never be satisfying. In this case, part time job matters in improving our ability in social communication and efficient working. We may gain experience and life skill in part time job as well. Finally, college students belong to the high-consuming group. I won't say whether we should save money or not, but I hope everyone to respect our parents' money. There is a way to solve this embarrassing situation, that to apply for a part time job."
212,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ This is a discussion about if it is right for college students to have a part-time job. Some students think that it is important for us have the chance to have a part-time job to broaden our view. However, there is still some students think that it is no need for us using time and energy to have a part-time job. In my opinion, I think that it is very important for us college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, having a part-time job can help us make good use of our time. Because most of us use our time on playing computer games or playing with friends after class. Secondly, having a part-time job can give us more experience. It will make us college students more confident and mature for future. Besides, having a part-time also can make some money, can't it ? We can use the money we make buy some things we need. For example, the professional books or tools. What's more, we can live easier with the money. In one word, I agree with the students who think that it is important for college students to have a part-time. And it is the time for us to take a action!"
213,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think, as a university student, if we have the chance, we should take a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, we can earn some money so that parents' burden can be reduced. Though it is not too much, our parents can know that we understand their pressure and that we are trying our best to do all that we can. our parents will feel happy to see this. Secondly, if we work as a teacher in your part-time job, we can review what we have learned. Our students and we ourselves can promote at the same time, which we may be not realize until we have made progress obviously. Thirdly, we can get the ability to communicate with people in society, which is very important when we work in companies in future. since we are students, we get along only with students every day. As a result, when many graduates enter the society, they cannot adjust to the difficulties and challenges at the beginning, but if we have taken part-time jobs, maybe it can be avoided. However, many students hold the opinion that taking a part-time job may waste our time, As a students, what is the most important is studying, we can earn money after we have graduated. In my opinion, taking a part-time job does not mean that we are wasting our studying time. Because it depends on the way you arrange your time. As a college student, we should have the ability to make our time to be full used. Certainly, everyone has their own opinion on the topic, just do what you think is right."
147,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. Smoking in public is prohibited. Now, in many public places are set special smoking-room, giving people who want to smoke providing a place. In my opinion, this is a very good method to prevent people from smoking in public places. Why we all say that smoking is harmful? Although in some smokers opinion, smoking is to alleviate the pressure of work, can let their spirits up. But, smoking has serious threat to people's health. Our health is very important. We can reduce our stress by many other ways. For example, we can go out to travel or chat with friends. These are some useful method to release our minds. Then, Smoking let us spend a lot of money. This is a kind of unnecessary spending. If we donate these money to the hope project, it will be how meaningful. Smoking in public is very immoral. Because, while your smoking in public, other non-smokers also can be affected. We should consider for others because this is very important. For the sake of our health, we should try to minimize the number of smoking. In a word, smoking is harmful to our health."
320,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays many people smoke in the world. They smoke almost everywhere, such as houses, offices, restaurants and so on. They don't care about other people who don't smoke. I strongly protest that people smoke in the restaurant. Firstly, the restaurant is a public place. And we all know we can't smoke in these place. Why? Because it is a public place, we should keep in our mind that what we are doing should not disturb others. It is not our private space. To tell the truth, I do hate those who smoke in the restaurant. Secondly, a restaurant is a place for people to have their meal, not a place for smoking. We eat food in it. I am not quite sure whether those who smoke like chimneys eat food or cigarettes. The place should be clean and the air should be fresh. Thirdly, we know cigarettes contain nicotine and other harmful things. Smoking is bad for our health. It has proved that many serious diseases like lung cancer and heart diseases are linked with smoking. And what is worse is that if a person don't smoke but sit by the smoker, the danger is higher than the smoker themselves. In the end, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. And I suggest that smoking also should be banned in every public places."
389,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with the statement that having a part-time job is important to college students. My reasons are as follow. First of all, having a part-time job can teach us a lot through practice. As is known to all, our 4 years in college is a precious period in our life, during which we should not only learn how to study, but also learn about how to do. Compared with the academic activities like holding lectures, discussions or debates which aims to improve our learning skills, the do part has been largely ignored on the campus, though it is agreed that the latter one counts more when we step into society. Under these circumstances, it is the best choice that we take a part-time job outside the school. Second, when we are getting the experience, we also get paid. In some countries, students are already economically independent from their parents when they step into the university, but we are not. With a part-time job, we can get some burdens off our parents by using our own-earned money. Moreover, we can taste the pleasure of earning ahead of those without a part-time job. Third, we can get into another circle of people called the workmates. Unlike schoolmates and roommates you share joy with, workmates are those who work hard with you. You conquer difficulties together, and that would cultivate special feelings which you would probably value in a lifetime. In conclusion, having a part-time job can benefit us a lot without taking up too much time. So it's important and beneficial for students to get one in their college years."
229,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Several months ago, some policies on smoking were introduced by the government to stop some people from smoking in the public. However, as far as I know, the conditions are almost still the same, and I hold the firm belief that smoking in the public should be banned. The first reason, as is known to all, is that smoking is very bad for our health, and it also does quite a lot of damage to the environment. If someone smokes in public, not only he himself, but also the people around are affected by the smoke. According to the research, the smoke will have a worse influence on the people around than the smoker, which is really surprising. It is known to all that smoking will cause diseases like lung cancer, heart disease and so on. Besides, the smoke also damage the environment and then we may feel uncomfortable. In my opinion, smoking almost has no advantage but all kinds of disadvantages. In addition, we may ignore the fact that smoking in public may also cause fire, and it is really important to prevent it. If the cigarette is on fire and it is thrown, then something may cause fire. The result is very dangerous and we really should do something to prevent it, stopping smoking is the most useful method. So in a word, smoking has no advantage but all kinds of disadvantages. It must be banned in the public and everyone of us should tell others not to smoke in public any more."
281,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Nowadays, more and more university students start to do a part-time job. Should we do a part-time job in our university life? People have a discussion about this phenomenon. Is it important for university students to do a part-time job? In my opinion, this point is right, because doing a part-time job has some benefits. First, I think in the university we learned things which is just about our profession. So it is very narrow. We should learn other knowledge from doing a part-time job. Second, they can get some cash, they can not ask to their parents for money. This way can solve some economical problems. Thirdly, in a survey about what can you describe about you university life? 60% students said they did not know what should they do, they had many time but they did nothing once. They wasted a lot of time. So they could do a part-time job so that they can level up the experience. We are in great times, then we must do something in order to become a real person in the society. Besides, in our future life we can know about the advantages. So it is a good choose to do a part-time job."
368,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Maybe it looks cool to have a cigarette. However, the fume from the cigarette is more harmful for others around you. I do agree to ban smoking at a public place, such as restaurant. Today, there are too many people in China smoking and too many people leading a bad life. When they have a cigarette, their lungs will become black. And when they have one more, it will be blacker. As a result, it will maybe cause them a pneumonia, or a more serious disease. However, maybe you do not know that people nearby a smoker will be affected more seriously. Fume form a lit cigarette has much more poisonous substance than that is insoaked in. So it should be banned smoking in a public place, where there are many people. Banning smoking can weaken pollution and make a stable and peaceful living environment. When we have a dinner in a smoking banned restaurant, we will feel good though then we will have no bad feeling, which is our want to have and appreciate. I do agree to ban smoking in a public place."
094,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As everybody knows, smoking is a bad habit that doesn't have any advantages. Smoking may conduct heart-disease or lung cancer or some other disease. But why there are still some people like smoking? Smoking is a habit; it is not easy to give up it. There comes a topic that should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My answer is I don't think so. Of course smoking is bad, but we should take the people who like smoking into consideration. It is unfair for them can't smoke at all the restaurant if cigarettes are still sold. But should smoking be allowed at all the restaurant? The answer must be no for it is unfair for the people who don't smoke. Then what should we do? In my opinion, all the restaurants should be departed into two parts---smoking area and non-smoking area. It can not only fulfillment the people who smoke but also not bother the other people who don't smoke. So I think it is a wonderful idea. Of course, I wish all the people like smoking can give up smoking some day and all the cigarettes will disappear in the future. On that day, the question we are talking about will not exist any more."
095,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking, which is a cruel killer for our healthy body; it's not serious to regard it as a fierce monster at all. As a result, smoking itself brings no good anyway, and being smoked is more dangerous and the more important is that we should take an active part in voiding this unnecessary damage. As the first step, I think smoking should be completely banned in public, especially at the restaurant, where so many people gather to have a rest and lunch. For one, smoking itself is not a beneficial thing, we shouldn't allow it to exist in principal, but the fact is, we can see smoking here and there. Under the circumstance, for another, measures should be taken to forbid the smokers smoking at all restaurants for the sake of most people, like the older, women and children, it is our duty to keep them far from smoking. In addition, our country has our special situation: first, we burden the heavy pressure of a large population, and then, we couldn't deprive the life of smoking for the smoking-industry still contributes greatly to our GDP. But even this, our government should make policy from the essential benefit of people, and firstly partly ban smoking at all restaurants, as with the deep development of our country in future, we will get the smoking out of our land completely and pay back a clean air for all of us. Last but not the least, for every person of our country, we should do all we can to build a comfortable atmosphere, and stay away from smoking, which is not only a kind of care for people around us, but for ourselves."
260,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public places. No mattter what reason you may possess, no matter how willing you are for smoking at that moment you are in the public place, as a result, you can not smoking there. On one hand, smoking in public places is an unmoral behaviour. As we all know, there are usually many people in public places. And I suppose there are lots of people hate somebody who smokes in public places, not only for the places not belong to his or her only, but also for the healthy environment. The smoking activies actully seriously injure the smokers' organs especially for that lung, says the statistics from the WHO, there is more than one third people died in lung cancer simply caused by that smoking. Not only the people who smokes suffer this disease, but also the people who breathe the bad air--the smoke, will face the danger of catching the lung disease. What is more, the smoke coming from the cigarettes is bad for the environment. And it is linked to the greenhouse effect to some degree. We all need a better place to live in, so forbidding smoking in public places is a way of protecting our environment. In the end, I still say that smoking absolutely should be banned in public places without doubt, not only for the smokers' health, but the publics', and to be more, for a more confortable life, a cleaner sky, an enjoyable air. a more beautiful earth."
007,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, there still exist many uncivilized behaviors in the public such as smoking, spitting, littering. Especially, I believe that smoking recklessly in the public both does harm to the health of people and to the environment. So, I support the initiative that smoking should be completely banned in the public. The following reasons can be figured out to support the argument. Undoubtedly, banning of public smoking is not only beneficial to others but also to the smoker's health. If smoking is banned, smokers may smoke less, there are less second hand smoking released into the air, so people have less chance to be exposed to the polluted air. Furthermore, no smoking environment will bring us fresh air and good mood. This will obviously promote cultural and ideological progress by forbidding bad manners and developing good ones. In addition, it is a reminder that we should improve our awareness of caring others. Since it is not only beneficial to the smokers themselves but also to the society, why not take it?All mentioned above tell us the advantages of the banning. It is time to take the advice of banning and to put special emphasis on the improvement public environment though it is a litter harsh to the smokers."
135,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, we turn lazier and lazier with our life's being more and more well-off. Perhaps you are very unhappy to hear this, but it's the truth.. Especially in our parents' protective wings, we lack the passion of doing hard works. Before we went to college, our parents had designed the future life for us. So we are used to accepting their arrangements and don't want to pay too much. Unlikely to our parents, they did many hard labors when they were youngsters. Therefore, I think it's reasonable that many people called this generation to be the flowers in warm house. Thus, I don't like this opinion. To get rid of this saying, I advise that all college students do part-time job. It is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, many college students have been addicted to their parents' concern for a long time so as to lose their self-existence ability. Taking a part-time job can force them learning how to be independent. Secondly, it will make them treasure money and don't waste money. Thirdly, it can help them form working experience so that they will be easier to find a decent job after they graduate from college. It is acknowledged that almost every company has demand in employee's working experience when they employ a stuff. Forthly, it can strongthern their mental ability in bearing failure. You know, to a person never meet any difficulity, once he suffers from a few obstales, maybe he will break down. Concludely, in my perspective, it has necessity that we should stumilate college students' motivation in doing part-time job. In modern society, inevitably, a person who can only study in books wouldn't be accepted by the public."
352,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Nowadays, a lot of students take part time job. I think it's somewhat significant for us. The main reason for taking a part time job is that we can get experience we need but still lack. We have been studied in school for more than ten years learning knowledge in art and science. But we hardly got knowledge of working and how the society and companies operate. Taking a part time job may force us to adapting to the environment we are in, that is, society and company staff. We can learn how to relate with seniors and with partners and what the condition of the company and people doing this kind of job is in. These experiences are not only useful in our future to get used to society quickly but also help you get the appreciation of employers so that helping to get a job you long for. So having had a part time job is an important chip in obtaining employment. Next, you can enrich your life after class. Many students only surf on the Internet charting and playing games. Some of them even get addicted to games and causes their absence for class. But if you have a part time job you won't have much time playing. In this way, getting a part time job really helps when avoiding oneself to games and useless chatting. But there are some tips you must know before taking a part time job. First, you should insure that the job is not contra to law and moral. Next, study is still your main task and do not let the job to cumber with your study. And you should also consider whether you are fit for the job and how the job affects your future."
254,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ No matter how others think about smoking, I believe smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. Millions of people die from smoking each year. What is worse is that smoking not only ruins the smokers' own health, but also breaks the health of all the persons who stay with them. When a person smokes in the restaurant, the harmful gases will escape into others' lungs. For this reason, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country, even in the world. I even think all the public place should have no smoking at all, but it is too difficult to come true. Rome is not build in one day. We cannot hope that all the smokers are away from the cigarette in a few days, so we should do something to help the smokers before they stop smoking. We should allow smokers smoke in some place alone in all restaurants in our country, but they mustn't smoke once they are not in the smoking area. Smoking has no good for everyone, but there are so many persons smoking in the world. Their reasons are various, but there is only one result, which is not good. In a word, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country."
032,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, smoking is bad for our health. So some people choose not to smoke. But sometimes even non-smokers are forced to smoke. Yes, that is second hand smoking. So in my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because restaurant is a public place. Most people are for the ban. So am I, and I think it a wise choice. Smoking will do harm to smoker's lungs and cause many diseases such as heart attack and even lung cancer. What's worse, passive smoking may cause worse effects. So smoking in public places is irresponsible to both smokers and people around. For each other's health concerns, smoking should be banned in restaurants. Though most people agree with it, when it comes to exercise, some people still act negatively. Some think it as unpractical because smoking people occupies most of the customers and it is equally important to protect smokers' freedom. But I think starting it from now on is wiser because it makes no sense to leave it alone until the problem become much worse. The government should try to set some regulations that all the restaurant ban people from smoking inside of the restaurant. If they really want to smoke, they can go outside of the restaurant to smoke and it won't influence others."

So many policies have been put out to forbid the smoking in public places, like library, transportation services and other public sites. And I think smoking should be banned in restaurants across the country as well. For the first reason, smoking in restaurants is extremely harmful to human health system. In most restaurants, the air flows slowly. It means if someone smokes in a restaurant, the nicotine will remain in the restaurant for a long time, haunting around the neighbor tables. This provides people with more chances to get illness. Additionally, smoking in restaurants will have negative influence in other consumers. The smelly air containing nicotine will make people sick and uncomfortable. Suppose a family is spending their happy time, in the big brother's birthday. However they are affected by the smelly smoke and the happy family dinner is ruined. Actually, this is not we want to see. Plus, smoking is not kind of good behavior in China. In order to enhance the civilization and make the city a better place to live, a ban toward smoking should be acted out in the restaurants. By banning the smoking in public place, people would be happy without concerns about annoying smokes."

According to a recent survey, there is a dramatic increase in the number of students who devote time to extra-curricular activities, community involvement and part-time work. As students attach more importance to part-time job, is it virtually significant to do that?As far as I'm concerned, taking a part-time job is of necessity. In the first place, through working with other people, students can learn how to get well with others. It is a chance to develop interpersonal communication and the ability of settling problems with a team. In the second place, college students usually focus on academics, but known rarely about the society. Doing a part-time job is good for real life experience. It helps students learn how to adapt to the norms of the society they live in. In the third place, many students spend too much money and make their family under the financial pressure. Even though the majority of students can't accumulate much wealth from the job, it helps their parents to release from the burden to some extent. We do know that time is the most valuable and the most perishable of all our possessions. To my thinking, we should arrange our time properly to do part-time job and study hard at the same time. We should make sure that we put ourselves on a more competitive footing when we leave college."

Someone think taking part-time jobs is good to students. In their opinion, it is a good way for students to be independent. And students can make money by themselves, so they will know the value of money and the tiredness of parents. Lightening the burden of the family is also the benefit of taking part-time jobs. By taking part-time jobs, students will know the difficulty of surviving in the society. Others think students should not take part-time jobs. In their opinion, studying is the most important thing that students should do. Taking part-time jobs will take much time that students should put in study. And, after doing the jobs, students will be so tired that they do not want to study. What is more, the money they make is too less, so it is not worthwhile. In my opinion, students should have a plan. If they have enough time, they can take part-time jobs, because it is a exercise to them. And students can make friends when working. But it is bad for students to take part-time jobs when they do not have enough time. If so, they can not study well"

People are discussing whether it is important for college students to do part-time job. Like one coin has two sides, advantages and disadvantages exist as to it. On the one hand, it is good for us to have a part-time job. To start with, along with the high pace of the modern world, more and more companies pay more attention to word experience. They must do a good job to promote their ability. Their practice will enable them to better understand what they learned from books. Students can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job-hunting. What's more, they can earn some money though these experiences. It can make the students realized that it is hard to make money. One of the most important reasons is that let them know the hardship of making money. Then they can develop a habit of saving money. During this period they can know how much they owe to them. Part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families and cannot afford to pay college fees. Last but not the least, it opens them a window to know about the society, which is essential to their maturity. On the other hand, if we break the balance our study and work, it makes no sense. Study is of importance to us students. We must spend most of our time in study to reach our goal. We must deal with our study and work well, spend their spare time taking part-time jobs. Only following this principle can they benefit from their part-time jobs."

As a college student, we have a lot of free time; why not make full use of them to do a part-time job. There are lots of advantages to do a part-time job. It can not only help students promote their study through their part-time jobs, but also can offer us an opportunity to go beyond what we have been taught in class, and we will learn more knowledge in practice. In addition, students can also accumulate work experience through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job hunting.

In my opinion, it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job. On the one hand, part-time job gives us more opportunity to understand the society. The reason why we stay in the school is that we are preparing for the job in the future. The experiences we gain from the part-time job will become our priceless wealth. When me ask a job, the interviewer usually ask us whether have experience. Without experience, we still cannot be able to take over a job successfully. On another hand, part-time job helps us become more independent. Sooner or later, we will depend on ourselves when our parents past away. During the period of part-time job, we will know how hard it is to make money. In addition, we can widen the sight and make friends with others. Finally, part-time jobs can broaden our horizon of mind and make our life more meaningful. In general, as a college student, we should try our best to have a part-time job.

Therefore, in my opinion, smoking should be seriously banned in public places. Smoking cigarettes causes bad air conditions, especially in the sealed spaces, such as restaurants, library, buses and supermarkets. Smoking leads the air conditions much worse where air is not circulated well. Even if there is open enough, people who get close to the smokers will also smell the smokes, unable to breathe the fresh air. If smoking isn't forbidden in the public, more and more people's health are endangered because of second-hand smoking. Smoking can also causes fir disasters. And there are more people in public places, it may cause more deaths and injuries, property loss as well. What's more, smoking in public places gives an example to persuade people to smoke, especially the teenagers. Then more and more people get the bad habit. Finally it becomes a vicious circle and damages the health of society. In a word, it is quite necessary and important to forbid smoking in the public. In order to protect people's health, to prevent the spread of the virus, to advocate the non-smoking and to live a better life, everyone should try their best to forbid public smoking as much as possible."

A large number of students choose to take a part-time job to fulfill their campus life. In fact, large part of their parents don't support them doing part-time jobs. In contrast, I maintain that it's important to have a part-time job. Firstly, the college students are innocent as they have never been touched with society. Through doing a part-time job, they can learn some practical skills what can't be learned from the class. On the other hand, an increasing number of companies need the employees equipped with working experience when they graduate from university to search for a job. What' more, they can make money by hard working to decrease their parents' burden. Also, it can teach them that it's not simple for their parents to earn money and develop a good habit of saving money. In reality, it's better for you to arrange when to buy and when to study, or it will have negative effects on your study. Above all, having a part-time job is to learn further working shills.

And in the various part-time jobs, we can know more knowledge in each profession. Through the experience we had, we can make a plan of our future. On the third, when we doing our part-time jobs we can turn our knowledge which we learned in school into practice. The last but not least, more opportunity will be offered if we have the experience doing part-time job. In a conclusion, we college students can benefit a lot from the part-time job. No matter in economic or experience. It can make us more independent and strong. We should take advantage of it."
040,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ There is an ongoing debate concerning around the issue as whether it is important for college students to have a part-time post. As a newcomer in college, I think that working out during vocation is an admirable experience for us, for the following two reasons. First of foremost, students in university have a great amount of spare time, some students will drop themselves into internet bar to spend their time after study. Of course, it is insignificant to waste our valuable time in this way. So, though work, we can be prevented from addicting to computer games and we won't feel boring in spare time. Secondly, for the young generation like us, doing part-time job means we can get working experience and reward. We can slowly become financial independent and ask less money from parents. We should know that time in university is so short; every one of us will finally get in society. It is obviously that we are laying foundation for our future through working part-timely. Nevertheless, part-time isn't always perfect. We must admit that as a young adult, we are easy to be cheated. So it is commonly reported by newspaper that university students were cheated when working out. There is still some risk exists. So, we should learn to protect ourselves when working out of school. It is also a skill we can't learn in our textbooks. On balance, I tend to believe it is significant for college student to do part-time job."
227,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Yes, I firmly believe that a part-time job is necessary to the college students, even if the others do not agree. Here are some reasons which can prove my conclusion. First of all, we can earn some money from having a part-time job. When on campus, we still need our parents' supports. We need money for life and study. So, once having a job, we can relieve our parents' pressure and be responsible for our own life. Moreover, It does great help to our future life. Having a job means important thing that we start to make connection to the society. We can contact with many people from all walks of life and we can obtain lots of information from them. It can benefit us a lot to our future life. Last but not least, a part-time job teaches us the hardship of making a life. Nowadays, because of the great life and the love of the parents, many students spend money at will. It can have a negative impact on the future. Doing a job can help us understand it. Although having a part-time job may influence our studying and our health, I still consider that it does great benefits on us. All in all, if we have enough time, we should take an active part in the part-time job. We can experience a lot through it and it will gradually become precious deposits of our whole life."
173,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There are many disadvantages to smoking. Smoking has bad effects on our healthy. The one who smoke in public, not only affect himself, but also affect the others around him. However, more and more people join the group of smoking, especially the young people. They are curious to smoking and are attracted to have a try. What's more, some people smoke in anywhere such as restaurants without others' feeling. Face this phenomenon; some people suggest that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. The restaurants should be very comfortable where people can enjoy their dinner and chat with each other. But now in the restaurants we can't be so happily that we want to leave as quickly as possible. Why? Because almost every man is smoking, there is no room for people to breath. The women and children all can't stand completely. Also the guests can not have the sense of which family are eating together at home, they will feel disappointed to the restaurants. And it is very hard for the restaurants to develop in the future. However, some people say that smoking in the restaurants is their right. They can smoke freely. In my view, I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country. We do anything shouldn't affect others."
315,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿From my point of view, I couldn't agree with forbidding smoking in public place any more for the following reasons. Above all, it is not only the smoker's health but also all the health of people around him that someone smokes in public will make a bad effect on. Take me for an example. Though my father never smokes, I still often cough out of the bad air made by smoking. Undoubtedly, there's something to do with smoking in public place. In other words, the success of the volunteers appealing us not to smoke is easily in vain because our health is still affected by smoke. What's more, if smoking is forbidden in public place, there will be a great improvement in our environments. It is obvious that the abandoned cigarrit will become rubbish. More importantly, many people are not aware that they should throw them into dustbins. No wonder there are ciggrats in the streets here and there. Only by forbidding smoking in public place can we solve the problem. Most importantly, in this way, we can decrease the chance that children are addicted to smoke. There is no doubt that children are will to do what the grown-ups do. If they see a lot of adults smoking in the public place, they are easily to follow them. Even though they discover that smoking is harmful, they can hardly get rid of it. In a word, I hold the view that smoking in public place should be forbidden."
314,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, smoking is harmful to smokers and the persons who have to sit by. However, is it necessary to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants? I don't think so. After all, smoking is already a habit of many people. If the government suddenly ban it at all the restaurants, there seem to be significant impact on the people being hooked to smoking. We can't simply ban smoking only because we know it's bad to the health. Also should we probe the reason hided behind the phenomenon. Many people regard smoking as an effective way to alleviate the pressure. Others think smoking can bring them the inspiration. And in some places, offering a cigarette to the person you meet show your respect. With more and more people gathering in restaurants, if they are not permitted smoking, they are likely to feel embarrassed. Suppose people can't smoke in all restaurants, some smoker may intend to choose having meal at home. The number of customer may become small. this is the last thing the restaurants want to see. And it's not good for the economy. So still allowing smoking at some restaurants seems to be proper. To protect children, they can't get in."
359,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. As you can see, many students in college do part-time jobs, and what the real feeling of them is that they learned a lot when they do their part-time jobs. College students live in school, in which they can just learn some theories. When they graduate from school, they know little about how to earn their living by themselves. They don't know how to use their knowledge in their work. So, it is important for college student to learn how to face to the individual life. Also, if college students try to do some part-time work, they can also reduce some pressure of their parents. Most of college students are adults, they are supposed to afford their fare in their life. Maybe parents do not want you to do a part-time job because they worry that you will be really tired if you do a extra job when you are busy to studying. But as a adult, college student must learn to balance them. What's more, college students have a lot of spare time, if we do some part-time jobs, our spare time will be full of happiness. And it will urge us to study more efficiently. Because of the reason mentioned above, I think it is necessary for college students to have a part-time job."
196,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿The prohibition of smoking in all the restaurants is an increasingly severe topic in the current society. Some people assert that it is reasonable for advocating the healthy life style, guaranteeing the environment of the public place and the other reasons. Admittedly, these opinions are true to some degree because sometimes smoking is not appropriate in some occasions like formal partys. However, I still think this rule is too absolute. First of all, whether to smoke is an individual's basic rights. He or she can choose to smoke based on its own desire, limited to nothing. Just like I said before, it is true that sometimes we should ban the smoking in some occasions. Nevertheless, it is unreasonable to forbid smoking completely at all the restaurants. Secondly, cigarette is useful in the many places. For instance, when a business man negotiate with another in a restaurant and they are both smokers, it is unavoidable to smoke during the negotiation. As we know, the mind of people benefits from smoking. So it is absolutely wrong to rule it in this situation. Finally,. smoking when having dinner is a traditional habit in China, according to the custom. People are used to smoke and offer cigarettes to others, showing the friendship and generosity. In conclusion, even smoking should not be advocated for its harm to people's health, it is still absurd to prohibit the smoking totally at all the restaurants."
358,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Basically I am agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job and I will show you some reasons to back up my point of view. First of all, we college students are no more those little kids who can not distinguish the bad from the good in society or even can not care for themselves well. We just can't live our life with our parents protection and care forever. So it is the part-time job that really gives us an opportunity to show our talent and burden responsibilities. Secondly, through the process of doing a part-time job, not only can we learn how to deal with various people from the different parts of world but also we can understand the complex society more specifically and sharply rather than read all those meaningless books in school. A part-time job can strengthen us greatly and then equip us with more practical knowledge to step into the world. Thirdly, we college students usually have more free time compared with the high school students so working outside will not affect our study greatly as long as we arrange our schedule appropriately. Lastly, we are already 18 years old and it's high time that we became less dependent of our parents and made some money to give them a little relief. Put the four pieces together, we can come to the conclusion that having a part-time job is of great importance and benefit to the college students."
197,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, there is increasing number of people smoking. Lots of smokers are smoking in restaurant. I think it's really a bad thing. I think everyone should know that smoking is not only a good habit but also not good for both the health of smokers and the health of people around them. So it's necessary to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, smoking in the public, especially places like restaurant, is a immoral behavior. It's really a bad experience that there has smoker around you when you were eating. I still remember a thing happened when I was young. When my family has a dinner together at a restaurant and a person beside us was smoking there and drives my whole family crazy. That's really bad I think. Because the restaurant not belongs to smokers. They must consider others' feelings, they must know they are in public, they must know there still a lot of people don't smoke. That's not a individual problem, but a social problem. If everyone cared about that, if everyone cared about others' feeling, they may not smoke in public. Unfortunately, it's impossible in this society. We must take strong measure to solve this problem. So smoking must be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country immediately."
037,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿After entering the Wuhan University, I find quite a few students take part-time at weekends. Their occupations range from giving out papers to private tutors. Is it really important for a college student to have a part-time job? I think it depends on different persons' different situations. One of my roommates always tried to get a part-time job. She believes that herself is an adult and has the responsibility to support her life. Actually, many students are eager to become independent and to prove his or her ability. As far as I am concerned, I take a balanced view towards this phenomenon. On the one hand, if one student can balance the work and study well, he can choose to have a part-time job which is within his ability. Besides, the tuition burdens of his parents can be shared. Nevertheless, when a part-time job will occupy the importance of study, this job is unnecessary and the student shouldn't afford the risk of taking it. After all, as a student, he or she needs to put the study at the first place. In short, we all need to keep calm at this crossroads. Think twice before we take actions is essential. If you think you can have the balance between part-time job and your study, you can have a try."
251,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more college students choose to do a part-time job which receives lots of public attention. An argument about whether college students should do it has been involved in many talks among teachers, parents and some educational institutions. And as far as I am concerned, in spite of some particular examples, there are some benefits college students can earn when doing a part-time job. As to students themselves, it is a necessary challenge that college students should meet to do more practice in the real society, to sharp our abilities in the fierce competition, and to acquire more experience in the comparison with others. All of these may finally attach great importance to our future success whenever looking for our career or applying for further study. Besides, compared with high school students, college students would have more spare time. There are always some students addicted to computer games who are surely able to choose a part-time job which will get more benefits. And as to the society, the participation of college students may bring in lively factors to the force market. The passion and energy that college students show will force others to be more active which may eventually promote the producing efficiency. And what's more, the pay of college students is much lower which means the company will save more costs and at the same time bring more profits. Since there are so many benefits, why not find a part-time job right now? Carried with courage, confidence and passion, we should catch the opportunity to take a training lesson. Don't hesitate and just do it. Although some difficulties may block your way, that's where the treasure hides."
036,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think it is quite important for college students these days to take a part-time job when they have free time. Taking a part-time job is meaningful and important; also it is a thing one should take serious. Needless to say, a part-time job can share our bills, improving our life, which means a lot to those in needs. To some extent, a decent job broadens our horizons; add to our understanding and experience of the society. What is more, it even helps to build up our confidence and interests. Moreover, a job enables you to make acquaintance of all kinds of people who will prove a great treasure to us later. On the other hand, as a student, study comes first. Failing to balance jobs and study, you will get nowhere. Anyway, I find it desirable to take part-time job at a proper stage. For example, as a freshman, a part-time job is an excellent choice to enrich your life. After that, you will get busier and busier. Obviously, it will be unwise of you to do it then. In a word, a part-time job is a wonderful thin itself and even more wonderful if we acquire the competence to balance it and our study."
104,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It said on the cigarette boxes that: it's unhealthy to smoke. Smoking is not only bad to the smokers but also to the people around the smokers. When someone smoke cigarettes, harmful gases will arise and fulfill the room. The gases do harm to the smokers' lung, bleed cells, heart and so forth directly, which make smokers have more chances to catch heart or lung diseases. The harm gases also will hurt people who don't smoke but surrounded by smokers unconsciously. The harm to un-smokers even more seriously, such as, it may make the babies in mother's body become unhealthy or even disabled. Besides, women, the old and children who always stay with the smokers are easier to get illness. In the meantime, the gases such as co2, no2 will do contribute to global warming. There are so many disadvantages for smoking, so smoking should be banned in public place, especially at restaurants. Because the restaurant is a place where people have meals and talk with companies. The harmful gases come from cigarettes will enter people's body directly and make the environment smelt badly. It's not only bad for customers' health but also for the business at the restaurant. Smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in the country."
105,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿How do you feel if you enter a restaurant full of smoke? I want to escape from it as soon as possible. So in my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, restaurant is a public place where people go there for enjoying meals. If someone there smokes, the environment is polluted. Can you enjoy a meal at a place full of smoke? The majority of the customers will not walk in the restaurant. The person who smokes ruins a fantastic meal of others and sometimes also a good mood. So banning smoking can ensure a good environment for the customers. If you have a choice, would you enter a non-smoking restaurant or enter a restaurant full of smoke? Smoking does harm to us and smoke makes us feel uncomfortable. So perhaps almost everyone will choose the non-smoking one. It also means that it will appeal to more customers if a restaurant bans smoking. It is a conclusion that smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country will benefit both the owners of the restaurants and the customers. So the policy should be carried out smoothly and immediately."
223,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿That's what I think of upon seeing the word smoking. Tobacco contains a lot of poisonous substance. So it is universally acknowledged that smoking is not a good habit. Smoking alone is equal to suicide, and smoking in public is equal to murder. It's very impolite to smoke in front of people who don't smoke. Smoking will make people around feel terrible. It will destroy your impression left to others. According to some research, secondhand smoking is more poisonous. This is one of the reasons why we shouldn't smoke. Another reason is because it is dangerous to surroundings, too. A cigarette can cause a huge fire if not dealt with well, which will ruin all your properties and even end your valuable life. And the factory producing cigarettes is also dangerous to the environment. The factory will produce poisonous gas and water. To some degree, this is also harmful to human beings. Have you realized that there are not any good results if we continue to smoke? We will destroy our environment, our friends, our own life----as long as we don't stop smoking. What a terrible thing! Cigarette is not a good invention. It has murdered millions of people. It is our duty to stop smoking from damage more people, from now on!"
176,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In fact, there are many college schools in our country, even some campus are very famous over in China, over the world. It just has a famous name; some schools acquire students to hand on lots of money. As we all know that not all of our families have enough money to pay for our education, including me. So, in my eyes, it is important for us to have a part-time job, especially on campus. Study is the most important thing for us in today's society, and we should put it in the first place. But who think about it that when we have dinners every day, what support us. --the money. What I say is mainly about economic. For example, when we finish our homework or some activities in Students Union at weekends then we can find a part-time job in the school or around our own campus. And this not affects our studies at first. Just look back, when we have the money which we earn by ourselves, we must be so excited at that time and proud of ourselves. In my point, on campus we should work hard and do the best about it. But on the other hand we also find a part-time job so that when we enter into the society we have enough experience to deal with it!"
383,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿From where I stand, it's essential for us college students to have part time jobs during college life. To begin with, we get extra our money from our own hard work instead of totally depending on our parents, which partially eases our family's economic burden and remind us it's time to learn to be independent. Secondly, during the working process, we will learn knowledge which can never be acquired in school classes and widen our horizons while talking to different people in the society. Meanwhile, we become more mature and experienced by learning various social skills. Last but not the least, we can feel the hardness of living well in this competitive world and become more serious about the money we or our parents has earned. All in all, part time job is an important tool to improve our social skills in all rounds and having part time jobs does help us dissolve into the society earlier than other students. Some students are afraid that devoting too much time in part time job may affect their normal study process. Although the academic study is still our primary concern, no one can ignore the importance of enriching comprehensive abilities. In contemporary society, professional skills are far from enough, we should go full length to equip ourselves with more practical knowledge."

They think a part-time job waste many time for students to study at school. Another people hold this view. In my opinion, I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job. This reasons for my choice are listed as follows. In the first place, with the development of society, company need a experienced employer. But college students lack a practice when they graduated from school. At college they learn acknowledge is not useful to future work.. It is not link to work. They find it is very difficult to find a job. In the second place, college students have a pare-time job could get some money to reduce family pressure. They could learn the values of money when they get money by yourself. They will cherish money because of they find it is not easy to get money. Though the above analysis. I think college students will be benefit from a part-time job. Whatever effects it has, one thing is certain, it have more positive effects than negative effects to college students. In a word, a part-time will help college students to have a chance to practice and have a better future."
068,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I don't suppose that it's a wise idea to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. But I'm in favor of banning smoking at some restaurants. On one hand. It's of great significance of banning smoking. Firstly, as we all know, smoking for a long time will change people's health; it might lead to lung cancer and other diseases. Secondly, you may feel annoyed when people surrounding are smoking and forcing you to take in the polluted air, it harms you too. Thirdly, I suppose that restaurant is place where the beauty of wonderful food culture can be showed rather than the place to show the unhealthy habits of human beings, also, the smoke of cigarettes may lead to the decline of our appetite. At last, smoking may also cause accidents, for example, a small cigarette may lead to a fire accident if meet the sofa, carpet. On the other hand, I am opposed to ban the smoking at all restaurants. The most significant reason is that the smokers also have their own right to make a choice, it's not that considerable of us to take their right away from them. Then, it's known to us that smoking is a culture of human society, usually, good cigarette or cigar can show one's taste for life and make a businessman distinctive. Smoking at table can also be one of reasons linking to their success of enterprise, especially in China. In fact, we can take other measures to create good environment in the restaurants, for an instance, draw a line between no-smoking area and smoking area. To conclude, smoking has its bad effects, it disgusts others when damages smokers themselves' health, but we are supposed to take some more effective and humanity measures instead of ignoring the rights of smokers."
069,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿At the moment, many cities around world ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. The new ban causes an intense debate among people. Some people especially the smoker protest the ban very much. They said that smoking is their own business, the ban influence their private right. They should smoke is their choice. Many smokers think smoke after dinner is very happy. So they don't like to stop smoke in the restaurants. Other people support the ban. They think that smoking is not only bad for smokers, but also harm to the other people around them. People want to have a clean place in the restaurant. They hate smell of smoke. Smoke will harm their health if sit very close to the smokers. From my perspective, smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants. As we all know, there are many poisonous things in cigarettes. Many people find that these things can cause cancer and some other illnesses. When someone smoking it the restaurant, the people around them breathe the poisonous gas too, it can also cause cancer. It is true that smoking is people's own business, but they don't have the right to have effect on other people's health. In short, I support the ban for people's health."
395,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking has always been a complicated issue in modern society in that most people know it is harmful but it can not be thoroughly banned strictly, even in public places such as restaurants. From my point of view, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. First and foremost, it is known to us all that smoking does great harm to human beings. Not only the one who smokes but also people stay around him will all get poisoned, especially when the people around are all eating, which leads to the harm to people's lungs and even cancer and it is widely known that cancer has now become one of the most dangerous killers in today's society. With the speeding up of our living pace and the rapid development of our economy, our human life has been rotten by industrial pollution day after day, which draws us a conclusion that we have to spare no effort in protecting ourselves phyically at least in aspects we can handle by ourselves such as preventing smoking as much as possible. Secondly, smoking also awfully affects our environment. It is estimated that smokers produce some kinds of poisonous subatances doing their enjoyable leisure time, which can proceed a series of chemical change with other substances in the air and finally turn out to be the contributor of our polluted atmosphere. Hence, in the consideration of environmental protection, smoking should definitely be banned in public, not to mention public places such as restaurants which should offer customers a comfortable and healthy eating atmosphere. What's more, smoking in restaurants will also influence the image of the restaurant, even the image of the city. Smoking symbolizes the terrible living habits of people and may impress everyone coming to the country with unpleasant feelings. All in all, for the sake of everyone and our society, smoking in restaurants should absolutely be forbidden all around the country."
161,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with banning people from smoking at all the restaurants in the country. Some businesses now say that no one can smoke cigarettes in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. And I think restaurants are the place where people have meals and relaxation, smoking will have terrible effect on them. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. In public places, the harm of a smoking is greater. This is connected with another effect of smoking. That is, smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous vapor off into the air. Therefore, that the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. Some people say that it takes away some of our freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking. All in all, banning smoking at all the restaurants is very necessary. I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also in the public places, everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us."
307,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As far as I am concerned, smoking is a pretty awful behavior, especially in public places, so I deem that smoking should be forbidden in public places. There are following reasons: Above all, smoking in public places not only does great harm to your own health, but also pollutes the surrounding air so that the other people beside you will be forced to smoke. According to some researches, second hand smoking increases the disease rate, such as lung cancer, heart attack, etc. In other words, if you smoke in public places, both you and people around you will be damaged. Secondly, smoking in public places will influence the image of the city. Imagine that some overseas people come to Shanghai only to find we Chinese smoke in the bus station. What impression of China they will get is obvious. In order to leave a good impression on others, we should not smoke in public places. Last but not least, after you smoke, there will exist some dust which will do harm to people coming into contact with it. In other words, it may affect people from further places. Besides the aspects upside, there exists many other harmful effects, so I feel obliged to forbid smoking in public places."
053,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As far as I am concerned, it is not important to take part-time job for college students. And it is just a matter of necessary, but none of important business. Firstly, part-time job doesn't make sure that you can learn something or it can appeal to your major. So we can't say it is important to take part-time job. Secondly, we say it is just a matter of necessary but none of important business because part-time job can just provide money and maybe a little experience. And if you need more money urgently, it is necessary but not important to take part-time job. Thirdly, it goes without saying that our main task is learning as much as possible when we are college students. Except for the classes, sleeping, eating, clubs, and maybe having a girlfriend, we don't have much time for our individual learning. So we cannot spend that amount of time taking part-time job. If we waste much time to do part-time job, our study will have less time to study. That is really a disadvantage of having part-time job. From the above, I personally think it is not important for us to take part-time job. We can make more money if we learn more knowledge now. So we should spend more time studying now than doing part-time job."
235,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿After entering the college, many students want to find a part-time job. As far as they are concerned, having a part-time job they not only can earn some money to pay their expense in the university, but can develop their ability to communicate with others. What's more, it is a good way to gain some society experience. There are also some people disagreeing with them. They think that as a university man we should make a good use of our time. Time should be used to gain more knowledge rather than to make money. Part-time job is totally a waste of time or compared with leaning it is inferior at least. In my opinion, taking a part-time job is of great significance to a university man who can benefit a lot from it. To start with, I would like to start with the question that what are the things that a university man should do. Is it just learning not participating any activity? I think everybody will say no. In the university, on the one hand we should acknowledge what we should learn from the books, on the other hand, we should how to become an independent person and how to enter the society. To many students, the part-time job may be the first job in their life. It is a start of an independent life. Then let's move on to some material gain. With the income that we gain from the part-time job, we can do something we like as well as pay our expense in university. I think it is a different feeling compared with that using the money asked from our parents. University is not only about knowledge, it is also important to gain some society experience. It is important to take a part-time job."
052,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Sometimes many college students gain a great knowledge of theory, while they really lack of practice experience. So I strongly believe that our college students need to do a part time job indeed. Several reasons are as follows. Firstly, you will be stubborn about something in your life as you just insist in the theoretical knowledge if you learn all the things in books instead of combining theory and practice. Be careful about the situation whether you are just reading books but do nothing. Secondly, after a short time of 4 years study in college, you are required to find a job immediately. It's certainly for you to treasure the time and to make a full use of the time. To do a part time job is a good choice, as you make your knowledge grow continually; you also get the practical experience of how to survive in the complicated society. Finally, you can add some colorful experiences to your resume when you are interviewed by a company, so you have the advantage over others as you have the ability to finish the work efficiently. It is all due to the part time job. In my opinion, it's necessary for college students to have a part time job to gain the work experience."
112,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Having said goodbye to the stress of college entrance examination, the students who succeeded in being admitted to the colleges find them faced more changes and challenges. On one hand, we hold more freedom and motivation in learn. The fellows around us having the same interests and goals as us, the teachers who play the leader roles in their subjects, and the learning atmosphere that can't be more suitable, these entire make the college be a right place to study. Maybe the college students are the happiest learners. But on the other hand, is the college just a place to deal with the knowledge on the books? In other words, do college students spare no effort to enter the universities just for studying? The answer, of course, is No. It is universally believed that entering the college is the beginning of stepping into the society, where everything is much different from that is in schools. Actually, rather than just being a teacher, a guide to help students change themselves from students to social person should be the colleges' main role. And to be a part-time worker, I think, should be the first step. No one will deny that the society is full of complication and is so difficult for us to adjust ourselves to. Then the part-time job make it possible to become knowing about the society in advance and lead us to begin to prepare for all kinds of challenges in the future. After all, the schools teach us what to do but who will tell us how to do is the experience we gain in our practice. So why don't we start the process earlier and, as a result, make it easier?"
113,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we become the college students, a problem occurs to us that whether we should have a part time job. I believe that everyone has his own opinion. As for me, I think that we should not to do the part time job. Somebody may say that we should forester ourselves at university, so that we can adapt to the society better when we graduated. Obviously, through the part time job, we can get some money, also, the experience, which can help us to know the society. If one lacks of money in the short run, he can do some works to get the extra money to improve his life. But the cost is that he should spend less time on studying the school courses. This may make him become less competitive than others when graduated. The bad aspect of having a part time job for us is not only what we mentioned above. After we finished the work, we would be very tired that we will not go to continue our course. On the other hand, the college students may be cheated when you have a part time job, maybe this kind of experience isn't what you want to accumulate. What was worse, having a part time job may build the students' attitude toward money is possible for them to think that making money is more important than studying. So, more and more students go to make money and less and less students to study. In the long run, the universities will not the original one anymore. As a student, we should always remember that our most important work is to study hard so that can we become the most competitive person when we go to the society."
088,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As more and more students taking part-time job, there is concern today about the advantage and disadvantage of doing part-time job. For our college students, part-time job can partly offer our study as the tuition fees have greatly increased and our bank systems fail to loan student effectively. On the anther hand, part-time job also get them know the hardship of earning money in order to change their bad habits. In order to be confronted with the challenge that more and more companies pay attention to work experience, they will feel easier when they attend job if they have part-time job which will help them gain work experience and benefit their future job hunting. What's more, part-time job do offer us opportunities to use what we learn into practice and even go beyond what we are taught in class. For me, what we need to do is to try our best to make a perfect balance between working time and study time. College offer us the stage of study as well as part-time job offer us the stage of practice. If we take a good knowledge of that point, we will surely gain great achievement in our colorful college life."
246,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I strongly agree that smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants in China. Although it is hard to make it reality, I still hope that one day there is no more awful smoke in restaurants. Now, let us talk about it objectively. Firstly, Smoking can cause a lot of illness including heart attack and lung cancer which is almost deadly for human being. As we all know, restaurants are public places which is crowded with people. If someone smokes in a restaurant, people around him will be affected by the harmful gas. In my opinion, smoking is not to blame. But for non-smokers, it is obviously unfair to be forced to breath other's smoke. On the other hand, if smoking is completely banned in restaurants, I believe not only the air condition but the environment of the restaurants will be greatly improved. There is no doubt that our mood will be better when we are in a smoking-banned restaurant. So it is also a good news for restaurants because more customers will choose it, especially non-smokers. However, the smokers may not support this policy because they need to smoke. In that case, I think we can build some smoking-rooms in restaurants for them. In this way, we can satisfy both smokers and non-smokers. Hopefully there is less smoke in public places in the future."
020,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿The argument whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is discussed hotly. I will show the different opinions below. Those who are in favor of the idea claim that we all know that cigarette contains many harmful materials that can cause lung cancer or other incurable diseases, it is very harm to smoke. On the one hand, it will waste a lot of money for smokers to buy cigarette. On the other hand, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and the people who smell it. And there also have many examples who suffered disease owing to smoke too much. So for the benefit of smoker themselves and other people, it is a wide choice to ban smoking in the restaurant. Those who are opposed to the banned hold that smoking is personal habit just like some people like reading and running, others have no right to interfere. Besides, restaurant is a place for people to eat meal and relax. So smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. As far as I am concerned, my favor goes to the former opinion. If the policy goes well, we can enjoy our meal in a healthy environment."
129,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is generally acknowledged that smoking harms not only people who smoke but also those who around the smoker. So it causes a social problem about whether smoking should be banned in the public places. For example, now we want to talk about whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There is no doubt that we only have a Yes answer. Though it is hard to carry it out, we have innumerous reasons to support this action. First of all, health comes first. Every day restaurants are full of all kinds of people. For example, if there are smokers in the restaurant, considering that there is no fresh air, the smoke will harm everyone here. If a man who never smokes goes to restaurants, it equals that he is forced to smoke every day. Besides, assuming a woman who has a baby in the restaurant, the health of the baby will be greatly affected. Then the illnesses caused by smoking will become more and the rate of death will rise. It is obvious that the average of lifetime will fall down. As it happens like this, where stands a healthy person in the earth? That is terrible!For the health of all the human beings, we really should take some measures. Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Then our life must be better."
128,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I hate the smell of the cigarettes. As a result of this, I support all the smoking-forbidden activities, though some of my families have the bad habit of smoking. This time is no exception, either. I positively agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Smoking not only does harm to the smokers, but also leaves a bad influence on the people around them-we just call those ""second-hand smokers"". Restaurants are the places where people eat food. If someone else smokes here, the other people in the restaurant just become the second-hand smokers. They always ""eat"" the smoke into their body while they are having the food. As we all know, smoke is harmful, especially to the children and the pregnant women. Restaurants are the public places, so the government should take the benefits of all the people into consideration. What's more, smoking while eating is a behavior that lacks respect for others. For the smokers own, they will give a terrible impression on the rest of the people. And the more serious consequence is that you may ruin your figure which you set up carefully. I guess that the people who are used to smoking have a completely different idea. They might think smoking-banned in the restaurants harms their rights. What we can do for this is to set aside a room as smoking room for smokers. However, all in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I will always be on this side."
181,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In our country there are more and more college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's becoming quite common to see students busy running errands after lessons. Some say colleges students are expected to do concentrate on studying, because study is just like their jobs. However I think it's a good thing for college students to take a part-time job while studying. Although it is a truth that for a college student, his most important goal must be to learn well and to get a high score in examinations, it surely does not need to be the only target. In fact, college life which consists of only study is not balanced and may cause the student to miss out on other valuable learning experiences. In addition to bringing more balance to a student's life, part-time work can broaden his social experience. He will have the precious opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and will be faced with a wider variety of problems to solve. Furthermore, work helps a student to develop greater independence, and earning his own pocket money can teach him how to handle his finances. Finally, a part-time job can help a student to develop a greater sense of responsibility and team-work spirit, both for his own work and for that of the team he works with. For all of these reasons above, I firmly believe that most students would benefit from taking a part-time job while they are at college. Of course, they must be careful not to let it take up too much of their time because study is still their primary responsibility. To sum up, living a balanced life is the best way to be successful."
165,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays more and more college students take a part-time job. About this, I think, it is a good phenomenon and it is important for college students to have a part-time job. A part-time job can bring extra money to students and this can allow they to buy things they need and relief their parents' burden. And students will learn to treasure everything they have and they will love their parents more than before because they have experienced the pain of making money and they have been aware of the hardship of life. Also, part-time jobs can give students experience of working which will benefit them when they look for a job after graduation. It will practice their ability to communicate and deal with problems. They can learn something beyond text book and out of school. They will find that life is a cruel thing and you must struggle for it or you will be punished by it. And at the same time, life is fair because it will award them with adequate gift if they work hard with their heart. So, when you are a college student try to get a part-time job and do it as well as you can and this will do well to you in the future."
302,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Is it important for college students to get a part-time job? When entering college, we find that there are many chances to get a part-time job. Some are simple like waiters, and some are more professional like tutors. In my opinion, for students who have difficulty to pay for their tuition fee it is surely important; but for the others, it may not be important. Firstly, learning in college is not as relaxing as people describe. We need much time to obtain knowledge include both in major and in common. When we get a part time job, we must reduce our learning time to work, thus causing a lack of time to study. On one hand, some students' score fall, and some students even fail in the exam. On the other hand, students are always busy in both sides, and always lack of sleep and relax. According to a survey, almost every student who has a part time job has difficulty balancing their learning and working time, and some admit that the job surely has bad impact on their study. In addition, we can find these jobs are simple and mechanical instead of challenging and fun said by others. That means, we may give our precious time and labour force to the boss, but not really get improved through doing these jobs. If we spend the time and energy on our campus life, we may learn more things, not only essential knowledge but also live experience. As college students, we should know that our duty is to gain more academic knowledge and make a difference in our field. So, a part-time job is not as important as that. Only when we become an excellent graduate from college, can we find a real good job and improve ourselves in society."
164,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is important for college students have a part-time job, not only for the money, but also the experience. Many students step into college without a good sense of controlling of time; they do not know how to use their time in a proper way. However, having a part-time job can give them opportunity to enjoy their college life. Being in the charge of other people, students can control themselves to obey the rules, so that they can have a good sense of time. They can know that not everywhere is just like school, not everywhere is so free. Meanwhile, during the time doing part-time jobs, students can study some more things that they cannot study in class, as well as they can take what have study in class in practice. These all cannot be studied only in school; only in society can students learn these. Besides, doing part-time jobs can offer the opportunity that students can broaden their horizon, which can be a kind of advantage in communicating with different people in different occasions. Many students in school are too shy to express themselves, which can be changed if they have a part-time job. Because when they do the part-time job, they will meet different people, they can adopt themselves to different people's opinion and attitudes. In this way, they will be more out-minded. In a word, doing part-jobs can make students enjoy their college life. If they use time in a proper way, they can make progress both in study and experience."

As a result, to take a part-time job seems to have become a fashion in college. Of course there are many people Those who support students to take part-time jobs have their accounts. For instance, they think students can put their knowledge leant in class into practice, and though this process they can know whether their comprehension to the very thing is right and obtain some new knowledge that they can't learn from class. In addition some students come from poor families need to take part-time jobs to earn money or they may have to stop their schooling, which is really a pity. Yes, there are many advantages of part-time jobs, but as the saying goes, every coin has two sides. As some people say, taking a part-job costs too much time which should be used to study. In that case, students' study would surely be influenced. That is not worth the candle. In my opinion, the advantages of taking a part-time job outweigh the disadvantages. Apart from the reasons above, I think we can improve our ability through this process and adapt to the society better."

As we know, smoking is harmful for our body, so these people who do not smoke refuse smokers smoke in public place such as some restaurants. So I think it is necessary to ban smoking at all the restaurants over the country. Firstly, there are many harmful things in the cigarette that can damage physical functions, at the same time the smog is more harmful. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. People who don't smoke can also be affected if they sit next to smoker. Therefore, there is no doubt that smoking does harm to the health of both the smokers and nonsmokers. Second, cigarette end can cause fire accidents. And we have also seen the cigarette ends and the smog can pollute environment that affect our life. Third, smoking in public places is a kind of impolite behavior in our society. It may affect people work or studying. Finally, no smoking at all the restaurants will provide a better environment for people enjoy their lives. So I think people will get benefits from it. We need to ask our government to do something from now on for it."
298,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more college students are fond of finding a part-time job in their spare time. Since I graduated from high school entered university, I have found we usually have so much spare time after finishing homework and reviewing the books. Unfortunately most of college students are used to spending their valuable young time in playing computer games, watching TV and other things. Of course, there are a few students still working hard at their study. On the whole, if we can't grab the gold time we may miss the best opportunity in our life. What we can do in our spare time? There are so many choices we can do. Such as do something we are interested in and good for us, taking part in some voluntary activities and so on. But I think what most of us will choose is a part-time job. Some sorts of part-time jobs can help us learn more about native custom and lifestyle, such as a home teacher. Because when we go to native a family to help a middle school student, we will get a chance to communicate with the family member, by this, to some degree. help us to learn about their life. Another good way is to find a job that is connected with our major. Thus we can review our knowledge and master it more firmly. The most important is we can form our interest in our major. By doing a part-time job, we even can lower our family's load and make us more independent. So I think doing a part-time job is so good for us."
057,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Have you ever watched a group of people chatting and smoking happily in the public? You can see smoking is everywhere, especially in a restaurant. As we all know smoking can produce lots of harmful gas, so it is necessary to put up law that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. There are some reasons. Firstly, a restaurant is a public area for people to enjoy a meal. However, if someone smoking there, others will be influenced by the terrible smell. The guests will have no appetite to eat anything. Secondly, it is known to us all that second hand smoking is more dangerous than smoking. The gas has much poison element and can destroy our body. In order to keep healthy, not only for the smoker but also for other people around by, smoking must be banned in the restaurant. The last but not least, restaurants are aimed at making money if there are so many people smoking, it may have a negative influence on the business. So the managers are urged to forbid smoking. In short, smoking itself has more disadvantages than advantages. Even though it cannot be forbidden in everywhere, we can make laws to ban this behavior in the restaurant. Then we can have a healthy condition when we have our meals in the restaurants."
231,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Personally speaking, I think smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, there are many smokers around us. They do need some space to smoke. Restaurants are not proper places for them, but that doesn't mean we should ban all the restaurants in the country. I think preparing some restaurants that only accept smokers is a good way to deal with the contradiction, for it can not only give the non-smokers a better environment but also give the smokers their own zone for smoking. Don't you think it is a good solution for them both? Moreover, if we ban smoking completely at all the restaurants, we may go against many smokers' will. At the same time, the government would be condemned by the smokers for it affects their benefit. In that case, they may do harm to the harmony of the society. Everyone has his own rights, so do the smokers. If we ban smoking at all the restaurants, we may break the balance of smokers and as a consequence lose their faith. In my opinion, we should open up some restaurants that are for smokers only. Only in this way can the society be more peaceful and harmony."
338,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ The saying: Smoking is killing yourself. , in my mind, must be seen in everywhere. I hate smoke, for the smoking brought me many terrible memories. My grandfather dead of smoking, the lung cancer that caused by years' smoking took him away from me when I was just 12. I just don't understand that why such many people who know smoking is harmful are still smoking. And the number of smokers has been larger when the age of started to smoke has been younger! It feels so bad that the people live with you are all smokers. But the truth is that China has the largest number of smoking people in the world! Smoke was used as a kind of medicine at first. Because of its unusual addiction, smoke was sold as normal goods by companies to make exorbitant money. In this way, smoking has many similarities with taking drugs. You spend money and health on smoke, making everyone who loves you to be worried. I hate smoke. In my point of view, smoking should be allowed only when you are alone. As the secondhand smoke which referred to as passive smoke can cause more serious health problem, people who do not smoke also are in risk when someone smoke around. It is unfair that you smoke cost other's health. So, smoking must be a private action and must influence in personal too. At last, I have something to say. To those smokers, you should love yourself, your family and your own live. One less cigarette a day means more love to everyone. To those who do not smoke, please tell smokers around you to quit smoking if you really love him or her. In a word, keeping away from smoke, as a result, long and happy life you will have."
339,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Recently, smoking has been banned in most public places. And the banning trend is stretching into the restaurants. For long, people are arguing about whether smoking should be completely banned at all the reataurants in the country. However, I'm in favor of saying yes, taking two influential factors into consideration. The first factor lies in the restaurants' atmosphere. Restaurnants are public places for people to enjoy their meals. And smoking is selfish when public places belong to all. Smoking at a restaurant not only sours one's own appetite, but has a bad impact on the eating environment, making others feel disgusting. Many people maintain that they won't step into a restaurant with a smoker inside. Thus, the behavior is expected to be banned for bringing harm to every one. For the sake of our safety, it's also definitely right to promote the banning. Can anyone imagine it that a cigarette end is carelessly dealt with in a place with oil everywhere? It can't be worse. Accidents can happen out of our expectation. Media always report restaurants' fire accidents resulting from lit cigarette ends. And we should make improvements and preventions upon the frustrating experience. In a word, smoking should be banned at the restaurants before more lives are claimed. Cigarettes are more horrible than we expect. It is time we took actions against the current situation. Only by completely banning smoking at all the restaurants in the country can we enjoy a sound eating environment."
279,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Can you imagine someone smoking just beside you while you are enjoying your pleasant meal with your family or your friends? I guess it might not be comfortable for people. Obviously, we come to a restaurant because we want better food as well as a better eating environment, but smoking in the restaurant certainly is ruining the pleasure. So as far as I am concerned, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. First of all, from either a personal or a public perspective, it is widely accepted that smoking is ruining our pleasure at the restaurant. In some western restaurants in which smoking is forbidden, the eating environment is much better and people can enjoy both their meal and their conversations better. But things get worse in the restaurants where there are people smoking. There are smokes surround you while you are having your dinner, you will smell a strange smell besides your food and if you are chatting, you and your friends will both feel uncomfortable. More over, the smokes around you are not only taking your happiness away but also damaging your health. It becomes a even bigger problem if you are not the one who is smoking. So, I think smoking should be banned. Apart from the point mentioned above, it might not be neglected that banning smoking is also doing help to restaurants owners. If smoking is forbidden, the restaurants will have a better environment that will attract more customers. Thus, it can increase the restaurants' income the same time it makes people think it is a place worth going again. In conclusion, since banning smoking is advantageous to both the customers and the owners of the restaurants in making the restaurants' environment better, I do strongly agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country."
185,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿People always have different points of view on even a tiny issue. So, people's answers to this question vary from one to another. Some people are in favor of smoking at restaurants while some others insist that it is unsuitable to smoke at there. For me, I agree with the latter. My reasons are mainly as followed:To start with, smoking brings many disadvantages to us. People who often smoke always get higher possibility of being ill. Smoking will cause a series of illness such as cancer, heart disease, and some other problems. Because of that, their lifetimes are usually shorter then those who do not. Secondly, people should obey their obligation to not smoke in all public places, including restaurants, shopping malls, transportation and so on. If one can't help smoking in public places, they should go to the room which is prepared for smokers specially. In addition, second-hand smoke does harm to nonsmokers more than to smokers. Smoking in public places makes nonsmokers feel unpleasant from time to time. However, on the one hand, others think smoking in public places is ok. They view smoking as a important table manner especially in China's tables. On the other hand, good sales of cigarettes bring considerable benefits for these restaurants. Maybe the restaurateurs will not give up the way of earning money. To sum up, what we should do is to improve ourselves to become qualified smokers. Don't disturb others when we enjoy the pleasure of smoking."

But I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. And as far as I know, there are a great many of people also think so. That is why?For college students, they have much free time, and many students do not know how allot it. If they use it do meaningful things that are great. But if not, how pity! However, if they have a part-time job, they use the time wisely. Besides, they can also learn much experience that is very useful. For example, if you are a manager of a company, there are two graduates looking for job. The former have abundant experience while the latter have little. Which would you like to choice? There is no doubt that you will choice the former. Another reason is probably that college students should take more care about their parents and try their best to reduce their parents' pressure. After all, they have been adults and they are able to make a live themselves. For one thing, they can learn many things from having a part-time job. For another, they can help their parents. Therefore, I think it is very important for college students to have a part-time job."

When it comes to the question whether it is really important for college students to have a part-time job, opinions vary from person to person. Some people believe that a part-time job can give college students lots of experience which they can not gain from the school. While others hold that having a part-time job isn't necessary for students who are still studying in the university. From my perspective, part-time job really do good to us. It is indisputable that the responsibility of us is study not work. However, we can learn things which we may never meet in school. Society is quite another world compared to the school. Though the job is simple, we are taught to be patience, endurance to hard work, optimistic attitude which we need in a part-time job. Job opens a window for us to see what real society is, a way to cultivate ourselves to be a better person, a stage to show our talents. Well, the pay we get can't be forgotten. Students as we are, we can prove that we still have the ability to make a living. We are not the burden of our parents. In a nutshell, part-time job is more than a job for us. It's our teacher of life and a key to our brilliant tomorrow."

There are lots of people hate smoking in public places have to suffer from second-hand smoke. So forbidding smoking at all the restaurant in the country is necessary. Smoking directly contributes to a large number of diseases, such as lung cancer. People like smoking have higher probability to suffer a cancer. People likes smoking also seems to live a shorter life. Smoking makes the environment in the restaurants bad, drives people into a bad mood and makes people cannot enjoy their delicious food. Smoking can also contribute to lots of accident in the restaurants. Lots of fires are caused by lighted cigarette butts, such fires always cause bad injure and big financial lose. So, we would better not smoke in order to live a better life. And to make other people don't get influenced, we need to stop smoking in the restaurants too.

Smoking is very harmful not only for smokers but also for non-smokers, especially in public places. There is a heated discussion about whether smoking should be forbidden? My point of view is, absolutely, restaurant is a typical public place. Smoking in public places has already been banned in some countries. It is reported that from next year on, our country will also take such measures, and sure enough, some smokers and cigarette makers are strongly against it. Though smoking is thought to have the function of social, in some occasions, ""have you got a light?"" can reduce the distance. But, what about the non-smokers, smoking affects non-smokers more than it does smokers, cause smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off into the air. In that case, the majority non-smokers ought to union to supervise and against smoking, for the sake of both themselves and others. For another thing, restaurant is a place where we enjoy delicious food, the atmosphere should not be disturbed by annoying smoke. If you are a smoker who tried and failed to stop smoking, you are not alone. President Obama are also trying to kick that habit and continuing his efforts to quit smoking. Smoking been banned at all the restaurant in the country can urge you to keep on quitting."

I fully agree with that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, gaining a part-time job is not only for the purpose of earning much money. What values more is the experience you get to promote your capacity such as communication, independence, your solution to an issue, and so on. That is to say, you can do things on your own if you gain some experience from part-time job. Secondly, it is a good opportunity to be involved in the society, forming a foundation for your future work. We are students but we are adults now. Therefore, the campus is not the only place we should stay. Outside school, you will see more interesting things. However, what I want to say is that a job will certainly take much of your spare time that your may feel stressed. So you should learn to schedule your time before working. In that way, I believe you can balance your time and lead a colorful college life."
011,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are reasons that part-time job is important. First, it can improve our abilities which cannot be educated in class, like communicating with each other. Second, every company that you want to apply to consider the real job experiences a very important thing. So when interviewing, you will gain advantages over other people by owning a part-time job. And the part time job is really a preparation for one's future professional job. But as a college student, the study of textbook seems very important, and we have all kinds of tests. Doing part-time job may have a negative affection on the score of tests, and may cause very serious things. And if your score are poor, you may even not have the right to graduate from school. And doing part time job my make you see the negative side of our society, eventually causing negative effect on your mind. So, I think it is very important to balance the part-time job with our university life. Getting a high score while doing part-time job is one thing that not everyone can make. So we should give up part time job ant certain time."

As far as I'm concerned, part-time jobs benefit us so much and we can try our best to take a part-time job well. Firstly, students who do a part-time job can earn themselves money which helps to release the financial burden on their parents. Also, that makes students know how difficult does their parents earn money. Secondly, they will have colorful weekends or holidays. They will harvest much more fun from it. Thirdly, they will meet different kinds of people, which makes students more independent and more mature. It's necessary for the college students to learn more about the society so as to keep up with the outside world. Knowing more about the society surely will be good to their future. Of course, students should play the main role to study. Part-time job is just a little part of their life. If a student spends too much time and energy on part-time job, it would effect his study time. As a consequence, taking a part-time job at your free time is a good choice and is important for college students."
083,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As a college student, we have a lot of choices to fill our free time. Some students just study in the library, some join clubs which they are interested in. Also, there are a number of students who choose to get a part-time job after class. According to some graduates' experience, having a part-time job is really important. Firstly, we have a lot of free time in our college life, and we all know that we have no excuse to waste it. As a result of it, besides study and clubs, getting a part-time may be a wise choice. Secondly, we can get some money from the part-time job, although it is not much, it can help to afford our cost of living in the campus. Thirdly, a part-time job is beneficial for us to improve our ability of communication and increase our working experience. It is universally known that they will be very useful when we graduate and need to find a stable job in the future. Finally, when we are working for the part-time job, it gives us a very good chance to build friendship. We will earn some unforgettable memories from the job. Even though a part-time job cannot give us a lot, it is still important for us to have it."
119,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is very important for college students to have a part time job. Now in many universities, there are some college students having a part job, such as sticking posters, to do private tutor, or to be the model. Students to have a part time job not only can make some money to change their life but also can gain experience. as a college students in the new century, who hasn't some societal experience, maybe will miss a good job, or miss a change of building a efficient network of relationship, which is the most important in the future. I have a part time job now. When some companies want to make a recruitment meeting, I and my classmates are working for them. For this, I can get a lot of money, and the most valuable, I have knew the recruitment process, so I can prepare from now on. If one overcome the sense of tense, I think his success rate will become high than who doesn't. And I have known several mentors they gave me great help. They help me pass through the confused in the university. I thank them a lot; we have built a hard friendship. So I think it is important for college students to have a part time job."
296,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿When I go to university or travel to somewhere, I used to choose bullet trains or planes. Not for their high speed but for they being non-smoking vehicles. Even now I could not understand the reason of smoking. Some says that cigarette can excite them and provide energy and others said smoking make them mature enough. Maybe I do not possess any right to blame people smoking because smoking is the liberty of them, but I can blame people who smoking in public areas. Statistics indicates that second hand smoking do more harm than smoking which is quite harmful. Smoking in public areas is a much worse behavior than talking loudly in public place. The latter is just disturbing others while the former is hurting others. What is the most unbearable is that people sometimes smoking in place where I can not avoid the smoke, such as in vehicles, in the meeting room, in the party and so on. Smoking people can not imagine the indignation and upset when non-smoking people smell the smoke and the atmosphere is destroyed. People should consider others feeling and try to learn to think at the position of others. I am really sympathetic to those who are addicted to cigarette while I argue against strongly to smoking in public place."
337,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In my eyes, part-time job is necessary for college students. As a matter of a fact, the final goal of learning is to master certain skills and to utilize your skills to accomplish your work. So the benefits of doing part-time job are evident. First, college students can acquire lots of experience which is quite essential when they are hunting for a job by doing part-time job. At first, they may cannot adopt the from learning to working. Inevitably, it is common to make mistakes, from which you would learn how to improve the working ability. Second, as students, we seldom have the opportunity to know the society. Therefore, doing part-time job is the first step when we are going to graduate from the university and enter the society. Third, you would receive your wages. Though the amount of money is not too much, it improves that you can earn money by yourself instead of asking your parents for money every month. Also, you can reduce the abandon of your parents in the economy. Two years ago, the rate of unemployment in college students is around 12 %. Nowadays, the situation of job hunting is still very serious. You have to do better than others, otherwise, you will face the danger of being out of employment. So doing part-time job is necessary for college students."
336,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, there exist a great number of college students doing part-time job during their free time. Some are for experience, and the others are for money actually. For me, my mother doesn't allow me to do that, she emphasizes again and again, 'we can provide you with absolutely enough money for, and just fix all of yourself on your major and your activities!' While I don't agree with this and I really want to do part-time job after class. As far as I concerned, to begin with, it is strong tendency that college students kill their free time by hanging on internet, so having part-time job to do can make us more active and make full use of our campus life. What's more, in my opinion, social life and campus life are totally different. A part-time job can be a real and convenient way for us to touch the society while in campus, which avoids us being too puzzled and frustrated after graduating. Last but not the least, little is better than nothing. We will gain some money more or less so that we can treat ourselves while enjoying the satisfactory. So I agree it a pretty good idea to have a part-time job when in college."
150,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As a college student, we should not only study hard but also enhance ourselves in kinds of aspects and widen our horizons. We can take part in all kinds of activities in the college. We also should take a part-time job to practice ourselves. It is known to everyone that we pay all our attention on study when we were in high school. Because at that time a high grade is the only purpose. Now the situation is different, only learning knowledge in books is not enough for us. We will step into the society after we graduate. so we must have practice skills. Taking a part-time job is a good way to practice us. It not only makes some money for our tuition but also enrich our college life. What's more, it is also a good experience for us to learn to communicate with others, which is important for the future work. In conclude, taking a part-time job is very important for college students'. We college students should take advantage of our free time to learn something which we cannot learn in books in order to become a useful person for society not a book warm. Taking a part-time job is a ladder for us to work in the future."
204,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As everyone knows, cigarette is not perfect goods for people's health. However, many people smoke in a few places, for example bars or restaurant, where they will have an effective communication. I do think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The most important reason is that it does make other people ill because they are breathing it in and smoking can deeply damage people's health even if they don't smoke. Firstly, smoking is the main reason for cancers. The more people smoke the shorter the can live. It could say smoking is the chief criminal of goods which will kill people. Secondly, it is also damage people who don't smoke. Restaurants are public place where full of people who don't smoke such as children and the old. If someone smokes at the restaurant, it actually changes the atmosphere of those places. No doubt smoking is very danger to our body, and especially it is more harmful to them who don't smoke but breathing smoke in. In a condition it is a must to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants in China for us and our next generation."
062,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In a restaurant, a gentleman dressed in western-style clothes snags his fingers and asks the waitress, handing several pounds to her. What he said to the waitress? Can you help me buy a pack of cigarette? what described above is a common phenomenon in majority of the restaurants. You may affect by those people when having a dinner with your friends or family. Every customer should have his own right in public. Let alone a restaurant. In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants. To begin with, smoking has a bad effect on the people around our both the mental and physical. The mental effect, as we can know smoking is the main cause of the lung cancer. To the smoker, it is a killer. To the people around the smoker, smoking may cause some unexpected changes in their mental ability. Take a little baby for example, if a smoker sits close to a mother with a baby in the restaurant, the baby may cry and shout out. What a unfortunate baby, what's the physical effect? For example when you see a handsome smoking, do you imagine his behavior will be an indication that boy should smoke if they want to be more cool. Several countries have designed laws to ban the smoking in public. This trend indicates people's requirement. All in all we should ban the smoking in the restaurant caring about other people around you."
063,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿When I go to a restaurant, I always see someone smoking. It is a very boring thing on account of I hate the smoke and the smell. Although almost people don't like smoking, but a part of people think smoking is their habit and we can't stop it. So there is a huge contradiction between these two types of people. On the one hand, almost people don't like smoking and they always think the smoking is bad for our health. When this type of people goes to the restaurant, they always get the second-hand smoking. it can affect the breath health with themselves. So this type of people supports to ban smoking at all the restaurants. On the other hand, smoker always think that smoking is their habit and it can't stop it very easily. Furthermore, the government supports the smoking because it is a big source of tax in finance. If we banned smoking at all the restaurants, it can decrease the selling of the cigarette. Generally speaking, to ban the smoking at all the restaurants is a difficult decision with the government. As the matter of fact, we should find a reasonable way to solve this problem. So now we cannot completely ban smoking in all the restaurants."
205,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China. Smoking produces bad smell. If smoking is allowed in the restaurants, guests would feel disgusting and the wall in the room is easy to become yellowish, which is bound to have a bad effect on the business because almost all the customers esp. the would prefer the non-smoking places to have a meal instead of where smoking smell are filled. Some may hold the view that the banning may be makes some people reluctant to enter the restaurants, but I don't think it is true. Customers would not refuse to keep themselves from smoking just for so short time, no one must smoke during their mealtime. Moreover, statistics show that majority of the customers say that they would come to have a meal as usual. And take the airports and the cinema for example, where smoking has been banned for more than 10 years, the number of the passengers wasn't declined due to the policy at all. On the contrary, some restaurants become more popular with customers after the banning has started. Ireland has already put this policy into use since 2004 throughout the whole country, followed by so many European countries, and British even use the strict punishment to make smoking banned, all which tells us that smoking are sincerely regarded to be unhealthy and the banning throughout the country is becoming a unavoidable trend. So why don't China follow the trend which could absolutely benefit us in the long run? Some countries even rule that smoking is only allowed in people's home. All in all, I suppose smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in China."
248,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Nowadays, a problem that whether college students should take some part-time job has aroused people's concern. The view points vary from people to people. Someone think that taking the part time job will take up a lot of precious time which should be utilized for one's subjects. While others hold the opinion that part-time job does more good than harm. As far as I'm concerned, taking a part-time job will have a deeply influence on one's life. To begin with, salary strikes when it comes to job. As the tuition and price of commodities increase dramatically recently, it could indeed reduce our pressure from economics. In addition, compared with the substantial income, the acquired working experience deserves more attention. There is no denying the fact that the fast way to gain knowledge is read books. However, books from library may be outdated, giving you useless knowledge. Knowledge gained from experience may be firsthand, direct, and unforgettable. Everything is changing and so is knowledge. If you go out to make on-the-spot investigation, it is likely that you may be pleasantly surprised. Last but not the least, it is likely to make good friends, who will help you in your career after you graduate. Part-time job will broaden our circle of acquaintances. No amount of ordinary school-work or lessons can take place of friends acquired in the job. Since part-time job benefit us in many aspects, we had better put our schedule in good state, and make full use of a proper part-time job."
086,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I agree to this opinion. We all know smoking is harmful to our health and it is a bad habit. I think smoking ban heart gains massive. The follows are advantages of smoking bans. The first, Bans on smoking in restaurants have had a bigger impact on preventing heart attacks than ever expected, data shows. Therefore, there are many good things bans on smoking in public place. In China, there have a word; children are the future of the country. However, Children exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke have an increased risk of development in adulthood, even if they never smoked. This is very dangerous to our children. So in my view of opinion, we must take a measure to smoking ban on public place. I think every Chinese knows many people are dead in heart attack and lung cancer in our country, this is cause to secondhand cigarette smoke. Though we are not smoking, secondhand cigarette smoke have a big harmful to our body. Now, many countries have law about smoking bans. Many studies add to the growing evidence that a ban on smoking in public places seems to have a positive impact on heart attack rates, which is clearly good news for our nation's heart health. Nevertheless, the statistics also shows how quickly the benefits can be felt after a smoking ban is implemented and indicate how dangerous second-hand smoke can be to the heart. I think it is a good idea to ban smoking in all restaurants in the country, everyone will support this bans."
249,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, college students have grown up to be adults, having a part-time job means that they can make money to support themselves. Although the money is just part of their living expense; it is a symbol of independence. So I think it is necessary. Besides, during the process, they will get more experience, which can improve their poor social knowledge. And they have to meet kinds of people including the kind and the bad, the young and the old. Then they are sure to know what means communication and cooperation. They aren't the center in the society any more, which is not the same as living at home. They'll learn tolerance and acceptance gradually. What's more, they can acknowledge teamwork deeply. And teamwork is what they must face after they graduate. What's more, they can know their disadvantages only if they have done work actually. They will try to use what they learn in practice, and transform the theory to reality gradually. Certainly, there is a premise that part-time job shouldn't affect their study. In a word, I am in favor that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
126,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more college students are getting out of the school and do some part-time jobs while still doing their study. So, what's the reason? Apparently, it is, maybe not necessary, very important to do some part-time jobs. The importances are as follows:Firstly, as we all know, the college education pays more attention not to the practice but to the theory. However, part-time job is a chance for the students to use what they got at school and to change their theory into practice. Meanwhile, it can enrich their college life as well as improve their work abilities. Secondly, the students will get much experience through part-time job, such as how to get along with their boss and colleagues and how to develop the attitude to shoulder their responsibilities. The experience they get can do much help to their job finding after graduate. Finally, doing part-time jobs can help the students gain independence, especially the financial independence? Although it seems impossible, we have the desire to make our own living because we are already adults. However, we can earn some money if we do part-time jobs. Thus, we can ask for much less money from our parents, which can make us feel more independent."
127,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, with the high pace of the society and the improvement of living standard, people get better education. Universities and colleges take in more and more students. On the one hand, more people have access of further education, but on the other hand, the opportunity of getting a good job largely decreases. It's more common for a college student to have a part-time job than ever, partly because they can make money to support the family, make more friends, and maybe mostly because it can increase their experience and let them adapt to their occupations and the society more quickly after graduation. There exists a wide debate that whether the college students should have a part-time job for the sake of getting possible working experience. The opponents hold the opinion that it will do harm to their study and their future career. On contrast, it is more widely accepted that it is important to do so but not necessarily. If the students does well enough in his studying, and have extra energy, seeking a part-time job can surely help him succeed in the future. But pay attention, the results differs in different situations. If he or she has trouble even in basic studying process, spending so much time in jobs is obviously unnecessary. After all, as a student, no matter in primary school or in college, it is more important to learn. All in all, whether to have a part-time job depends on specific situation. But the significance of a part-time job can hardly be ignored."
341,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It has become a trend that more and more college students do part time job outside. In my points of view, it's totally necessary for college students to do part time job. First of all, doing part time job can help widen one's horizon. We has spent most of time on study for almost nine years. Little time do we have to see what things are like in social, not to say practicing our social skills. Therefore, we should go out and do part time job when we are in college, in which time we have less pressure in study. What we learn when doing part time job will definitely equip us well for the coming society. Doing part time job has more advantages than this. The time we should do part time job is relatively stationary. So we need not go outside time and time to find social work to do. What's more, we can get some money from doing the job, which will cease our parents' stress with money. These are the reasons why we should choose doing part time jobs instead of other social work during college time. All in all, doing part time job does lots of good for us. And college students should do part time job."
332,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿The addiction to the cigarettes belongs to many people. And when it comes to the argument whether to forbid the smoking completely, the people can't make the same decision. Some agree when others are against. In my opinion, I think the cigarette should be forbidden. The cost of cigarette is a large burden,. Many people, including the poor man, spend thousands of money buying cigarette. It's a huge payment that most people can't afford. Maybe government can gain a lot from the trade. But in my mind, nothing can weight more than the better life of civilians. So the government abandon their small profit and forbid smoking immediately. Less smoking, less conflagration. In due time, every firing cigarette can burn down a town.. And most people won't put out their cigarettes, especially in the desert and forest, where there can have a fire easily. So influenced by the spread of no smoking, fireman's work won't be so busy anymore. Last and the most importantly, following the increasing of smokers' number, the amount of cancer patients also grow rapidly. Most lung cancer patients have several decade history of smoking. So for everybody who want to have a long and high-quality life it a must to give up your smoking habit. And if a smoker who had known that smoking can harm other people's health still stick to smoking, he may be too selfish. So considering the health of you and people around you, smokers should give up smoking. The three reason I listed above has explain my view. The policy forbidding smoking can benefits many people. So the government should put it into practice as soon as possible."
154,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country Almost at every place even at school, we could see some persons smoking. Sometimes, we can ignore the smokers; after all, they are not smoking near us. But what if they smoke in public just in the restaurants? In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In the first place, the smokers themselves are the most direct victims of smocking. As is known to us all, cigarettes contains a kind of material called nicotine which will do harm to human bodies, especially to the smokers themselves. Moreover, the harmful smoke will also have an indirect bad effect on those around the smokers. In addition, restaurant is a public place for people to have their meals. And all the individuals in the restaurants need a clean and comfortable environment. Let's say, someone smokes when you are having you dinner, what reaction will you have? I'm sure you will be angry and ask the impolite smoker to stop smoking or smoke somewhere else. Besides, there's no doubt that smoking in public can cause a dilemma situation between you and your companions. To conclude, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It will decrease the risk of harm the health both of smokers themselves and people around. At the same time, it also contributes to making a quiet, clean and comfortable atmosphere in public."
155,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There are a lot of people are addicted to smoking. So many people like smoking in the public without other's health and warnings. Why? Perhaps they think it is cool for them to light a cigarette and blow the smoke to the air. Or they form a habit of having a cigar in the mouth. But it's really a bad behavior in the public for both yourself and others around you. From my point of view, smoking in the public places will bring about a lot of problems. First, it do harm to anyone who around you. Cause these people are victim smokers. And among them, perhaps there're someone who are ill or sick, if they smell your smoke, they will get worse or evenly die. Second, if you smoke in the public places, our fresh air will be dirty in this limited space. Public space belongs to everyone and no one have the right to pollute it. Everyone have their obligation to contribute to our society and we shouldn't do something bad to our society. Finally, there will be more rubbish on the street such as the dog-ends. And if the lighting dog-ends are thrown carelessly, perhaps a fire will be set and it will lead to a tragedy. So it is meaningful to ban smoking in the public places. As we all know that people in our society should be of the educated men. It is our tradition and our rank to be a polite and well-behavior people so that our nation will become stronger and everyone in that general mood of society So, we should ban smoking from the root, it really do harm to people's health."
333,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As kwon to all, smoking is harmful to people. When you smoke, the tobacco burns and give off a lot off smokes that are harmful to your body especially to your lungs. A medical experiment shows that people who smoke a lot get lung cancer and other similar ills more than those who didn't smoke. So everyone should try their best not to smoke. What's worse, the medial experiment shows that one people smokes will do more harm to people beside him/her. Restaurants are public place, if you smoke, others will be affected. It's impolite to smoke in public places. If there are children eating, the smoke given off by tobacco will do more harm to them. Now, many developed countries have set series of lows to forbid people from smoking in public places, e. g. internet café, restaurants, shopping center and so on. Then, why didn't we ask people not to smoke and just forbid them from smoking in restaurants and other public places? Because we must take steps one by one. Otherwise there will suddenly be lots of workers who have no job. So I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

The supporters believe that a part-time job will benefit students for several aspects. First of all, students can get paid through their work which can reduce the financial burden of their family. In addition, having a part-time job can make students more independent which may be helpful for them to get ready for the coming challenges. Last but not the least, taking a part-time job will offer students some opportunities to acquire skills and experiences benefiting to their future works. The opponents criticize the supporters for their lack of long-term consideration. They hold the point that students must spare no efforts to study other than concern about other distractions. Only by study hard will they be well-trained so that they can start from a higher stage. As for me, taking a part-time job can only be a choice to students has lots of time. If students can't manage their study, they'd better not take a part-time job."

Although more and more people focus their attention on part-time jobs, I don't think we should do part-time jobs in college. We fell happy and proud that we go to the colleges we have long been dreaming for after great efforts. However we are faced with more challenges. The subjects we study are not easy to grasp. We also need to develop social relationships. Still, we need to take part in many competitions. Moreover, there are quite a lot of books lying in the library we need to go though. It is really a great opportunity for us to develop ourselves in all aspects. We are supplied with so many chances that we have no time to do part-time jobs. It would be better that we go out when we graduate. In conclusion, we should cherish the golden time in college for self-learning and self-developing. What the most important is that we would better keep busy every minute to make each day count in order to fulfill our dream and contribute to our society better. So do not do things that distract our attention from studying. Make better use of every day to make ourselves more and more independent powerful."

Someone think it is a waste of time for student who should spend much of in studying while some believe that it is a good chance for student to get the knowledge on how to earn money and how to live in the society which they have to learn when they leave school. To my point of view, it is important for college student to have a part-time job. First of all, it is a good chance for student raise their ability of living in the society. As we all know, during the recent years, it is hard for some student who just left school to find a good job since the company do not admit they ability by a piece of paper since the education system is not trustful. At this time, if they show something they got in the part-time job, it would be very useful for them. Meanwhile, as a college student myself, I find that we have a lot of spare time after finishing the courses required, the part-time job in spare time can enlarge our abilities of communication, teamwork spirit and so on. However, we should have a clear mind on the priority, as a student, the first mission is learning, part-time job can help us a lot, but if you failed a lot, you will still face many problems,. Beyond this, pay more attention with the contract when you what to sign in a part-time job."

In my point of view, we should not smoke not only in all restaurants, but also in all public places. The most important thing is that smoking is harmful to health. According to some research done by many scientists, smoking can lead to many pulmonary diseases, the most terrible thing of which is lung cancer. Smoking also increases the possibilities of developing heart disease, especially for women smokers. The damage can also affect baby's health through mother. And when a person is smoking, that doesn't mean that only he is smoking, people around him is obliged to smoke, too. It equals to damage other people's life in invisible way. That's unfair to these people who don't smoke. Here are some cases in our life. If we go to a restaurant for dinner, do you want your great meal disturbed by the unpleasant smoke. When you are we are waiting for the bus, a man site beside you smoke constantly just to get over his boring time. So what do the smoker would think if they exchange their roles? To make it a better world, we should learn to respect other people's feelings. It's necessary to ban smoking in restaurant."

Most of us may choose waiter as our part-time job during our vocation or even at weekends for its convenience. It's great, as a waiter you can touch many different kinds of people, increasing your experience which can't be provided by the college. Furthermore, what we should learn during our college period is not only the knowledge from the book, but the skill to cooperate with others and the method to enter the society. Part-time job gives you a chance to touch the hardness and the stress of the social life which can give you some directions on the way of your life. Most of us are the only child in our family, we don't pay much attention to the importance of the money since our childhood. Part-time job can teach us how hard it is to make money, I think nobody can do better than it in this area. In brief, I think It is important for college students to have a part-time job."

Entering college means the first time to be really individual to most students. And after all we will sooner or later walk into the real society and face many challenges alone. Definitely, while in college, it's quite a good opportunity to enhance our ability to cope with many difficulties that we probably come across later. For example, how to deal with the interpersonal relationship properly how to face the huge tasks that your boss set and above all how can we be confident. Doing part-time jobs can make us know more about the society and teach us how to be engaged in it. It is the golden time to learn new things at this age, especially this process of learning is like bury the seeds from which we can harvest a lot in four years when we formally enter the society. On the other hand, doing part-time jobs can teach students a very important lesson, namely how to make money and how hard to make money. For a long period, most student may have been accustomed to asking money from their parents. It cannot do any help to shape a correct attitude toward money. Whereas, part-time jobs can solve the problem. Through the work, students know it impressively that No pains, no gains. And they can also enjoy their own gains. Seeing their own efforts paid off, it must be a great joy. So, from where I stand, it is quite important for college students to do part-time jobs, which is of great help to their life, both present and future."
358,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I don't share the same opinion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurant in the country. As is known to us all, smoking does great harm to the smokers and it is even more serious for those who are around the smokers. With the rise on awareness of health protection, there are sever regulations on smoking in many public places such as hospitals, airports, etc. As is the case with some restaurants. However, if we prohibit smoking in restaurant at all, there will arise many problems and inconvenience. First of all, it is unfair for those who smoke. Just like my daddy, it is so difficult for him to quit smoking that he failed doing that again and again. I know clearly how hard it is for him to spend any one more minute when he want to smoke. So once smoking is totally banned in restaurant maybe my father will never dine out any longer. What is more, many people may try to break the rules resulting from not smoking for a long time. Thus it will cause loads of unnecessary problems. So how to solve this problem? In my opinion, we just need to set another room for those who smoke specifically then we can all enjoy a happy time together."
197,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As a college students, we have more free time. So we can choose some of part-time job to do. Everything has two sides. Part-time job also both have its advantages and disadvantages. Of course, There are many advantages part-time job can bring to us. Firstly, the experience. We all know that working experience is important to us in this society. Well, how can we get the working experience in university? Part-time job is one of the ways. No matter how, have experience is better than have nothing. Secondly, the chance. Everyone has its own ability, but not everyone has chance to use his or her ability. That's the point, so part-time job give us a way to have more chances. Imaging, if your work ability is good, you may have been noticed by your boss, then you may have a good opportunity to enter this company after you graduate from school. The society is full of competition. Lots of college students couldn't find job after they graduate. Think about that. Part-time job may bring you a brighter future. But on the other side, part-time job eat the time of study. Many of my friends said to me that they have no time to study. Why? Because of they have more than one part-time job. There's no doubt that they would have no time to study. So I think if a college student wants to have a part-time job. He or she must find a balance point between study and job. Anyway, we are still students, so we must have enough time to study. That's what I think about the part-time job brings to us. What I want to say is that if you want to have a part-time job. Just do it, but don't forget about your study. That's enough."
359,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Some people hold the point that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I completely agree with that. Smoking is a really bad habit that makes many people annoyed. When someone smokes, he influences people around him. The worse thing is that it may cause more harm to others than to himself. It is their freedom to smoke, but people should not to do it in public. When you smoke in public, you also force the people around you to smoke. It would be impolite. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for our health. You don't care your health, but they do. On the other hand, it is not safety to smoke in public place. It will be dangerous if you throw the smoked cigarette everywhere. It is easy to cause a fire accident. In fact there are seas of fire accidents are caused by smoking. Also, many people would fell sick if someone somke around them when they have a meal. Restaurant should offer a fresh atmosphere for people to have a meal. So, it is necessary to forbid smoking in restaurant. To conclude, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."
196,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Today, many college students have part-time jobs. Some people think that a part-time job is important to college students because they think is essential part of the campus life and do good to our future. The other think that part-time job waste our times. Well, in my opinion, I don't think part-time job is important to us. I have two reasons. First, as a college student, our main duty is study. We only have 24 hours a day, we only have about 30 days a month, we only have 12 month a year, We only have 4 years in college. So time is precious, time is important to us. If we spend much time in doing part-time job, we have no time to study, that's not good. When we graduate from college, we may be too busy to study. So we should pay more attention to study, not part-time job. Second, as a college student, there is a little chance to have a meaningful part-time job. Think about it, you go to find a job such like waiter. This job has no relationship with the knowledge we learn. They do this job just for money. That's not a good phenomenon because we only can learn little thing from the job. Although part-time job has some advantages for us such like help us know this society and help us gain some work experience. But as a saying goes do right thing in right time. As a college student, we should put study at first part of our lives. So I think it's not important for us to have a part-time job."
105,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Personally, it's important for college students to take a part-time job. One reason is that college students are not as busy as middle school students. They have more leisure time. Perhaps some students don't know what to do or they may be addicted to the computer games. They just don't how to use the leisure time. So taking a part-time job can make them feel a little more comfortable and help them make the leisure time more useful. Taking a part-time job also has many other advantages. The one who take a part-time job can gain more experience on getting along well with others. They can also make more friends easily. All these can help them become more acceptable when they seek for a job after graduating. So having a part-time job can help students be ready for the future work. Another advantage is so important that can't be ignored. Taking a part-time job can get more money. This advantage may be the first concern of the students. Someone thinks that making money can make them be independent from their parents. And they also have money to buy what they have dreamed for a long time. Concerning about the advantage to take a part-time job, it's important for college students to take a part-time job."
104,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we know, college is a period, at which students improve themselves both in knowledge and in experience. Other than, after they graduated from the high school, and came to the college, they have much more time after class than ever before. And since then, they can dominant their time freely. So making a good use of it may do great help to improve their ability. And having a part-time job is one of best way to make good use of their time out of class. Firstly, having a part-time job can provide them opportunities to meet all kinds of people and encounter different things, which belong to society only. And you may make friends or meet your Mr. Right when you have the part-time job. Secondly, having a part-time job can not only own some money but also own confidence. In my opinion, when you make money by yourselves, you will feel a sense of pride and achievement; in the meantime, you will speak highly of yourself and become more confident. Thirdly, if you can look for a part-time job relates to your courses, you can use the knowledge learned from school earlier, which will make you realize your courses thoroughly. Above all, it's important for college students to have a part-time job."
036,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Recently, the problem that whether smoking should be banned at restaurant is hotly discussed. I think the view point that smoking should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country has it reasons. On the one hand, smoking is a conventional manner on occasions like a meeting between friends. What's more, offering a smoke to a person is a generally accepted way of making acquaintance of him or her. In a word, it is smoking that often creates a relaxing atmosphere. On the other hand, it is also smoking that keeps many people and people who live with them from living a happy life. Many people have terrible diseases because of smoking for a long time. Also, the restaurant is a public place; these who smoke are to blame for spoiling others' health because second-hand smoke can be very harmful. People who are non-smokers will not have mood to eat when they sit close to smokers in the restaurants. On conclusion, I think smoking as a manner of long history, is impossible to be banned by law. The government and the press are supposed to try their best to spread knowledge about the harms of smoking. Thus, I agree with the banning of smoking at restaurants in the country. But not only by regulation, must we try to arouse people's awareness of the harms of smoking."
251,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is widely acknowledged that smoking does much harm for human's health and it should be completely banned at all especially at all the restaurants, which may not only benefit the person himself, but also do good for the people around. Like most of the other public places, restaurants are always crowded where different kinds of people stay together. They have meals, talk freely and at the same time have a lot of fun. However, it is often occurred that someone lit up a cigarette who may just be accustomed to this kind of relax but really bothers the others. People who don't smoking will feel very uncomfortable and unsatisfied, and people who smoke will tend to have a cigarette too which would make most of the other people around more unpleasant and not want to have meals any more. What's worse, those smokers obviously show bad manners, leave a bad impression and largely ruin their personal image. On the other hand, it is accepted that smoking does more harm to the people around than the very person who smokes. So the smoker really should be condemned as he sacrifices others' health for his own bad habits. OK, now imagine that you walk into a restaurant where there is so much smoke floating in the air that one can hardly breathe, would you want to sit down or even have a meal? Of course you won't. Therefore, for the sake of the fame of the restaurant and the health of all people, smoking should be completely banned. And as long as all of us put it into action, then the meals may taste more delicious."
037,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In our daily life, we can't ignore the bare fact that smoking exists in most restaurants, which has become a heating problem. Different citizens have different attitudes towards the phenomenon, however, as we can see, some restaurants have taken actions according to smoking. As far as I am concerned, smoking is bound to be completely banned at the restaurants in the country. To begin with, smoking is not socially acceptable, which affects both yourself and others. As a citizen, we need to shoulder our shared responsibility in the society and learn to be self-disciplined. Smokers shouldn't damage others' health in order to enjoy themselves. What's more, smoking at restaurants is immoral although the law hadn't made nay punishment for smoking. There is no denying that smokers have their freedom to do it. But choice encourages both freedom and responsibility, so as adults, smokers must learn to handle both wisely. Most often, I have the burning desire to arouse the public awareness of smoking, with the development of modernization and civilization of our society, the quality of people' living standard needs to be improved correspondingly. If smoking can be completely banned at restaurants, the whole society can develop more prosperously, peacefully and harmoniously."
176,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It can be seen at many places that selling cigarettes and some people smoke in the restaurant, especially the persons who do business in society. But they do not know that they have influence others' heath. From my point of view, in the restaurant is not polite for us to smoke, also give a bad impression to other people. Just around us, in a restaurant not very large, if a person smokes at the table, and the vegetables with meat will polluted at the same time, the fresh air will be the pollution and the surroundings will become worse and worse. They do not care about this, just enjoy themselves and do what they want to do. Smoking in the restaurant is not only bad for our own health and habits but also take the inconvenience to others. In China we should give a good example to the others all over the world so that after this we will be proud of ourselves. In a world, it's not a good thing to smoke in the restaurant. Even through we are the students on campus, we still should do it first and do it well, and smoking has a very serious effect on our health not only in the restaurant but also at every place."
223,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, college is the bridge between schools and society. Therefore it's in great need that we college students take some part time jobs. In China, students are used to the school life. They are just connected to classmates and teachers and can get money easily from their parents. They will feel uncomfortable when they are suddenly faced with the society. They will feel tired when they have to earn their own life. However it will be rather different if college students do some part time jobs. Firstly, they will have four years to get used to the rules of modern society. That will make the adaptation smoother. Secondly, they will be able to communicate with business friends instead of classmates and teachers who are always supporting you, which make their future development easier. In a word, a man with four years' working experience is always more attractive than a freshman. This is the major meaning of taking part time jobs. In addition, taking part time jobs can earn some changes to improve your financial level. I can buy something I like without asking my parents for money. That will make me feel more independent. To be brief, it's of high value to do part time jobs."
219,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿At recently, there is a heated view whether smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in China. With the development of the society, Smoking has became a world problem. there are more and more people to smoke. Many people think pressure of family, work, life lead to smoke. Though smoker have many reasons to smoke. they think smoking is own thing. But in my opinion, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. On the one hand, Smoking will be effect people's health and life. People will have a bad effects. Some people start to smoke when they are young. When they stop to smoke they feel terrible. They will feel headache. Whatever they do, they don't have no action. On the other hand, when you smoke in restaurants, you will be effect other people's health. It have worse effects. it will destroy restaurants environment. And non-smoker will be terrible. So smoker effect another. They maybe do not find their action will hurt anther people. Though analysis of above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China. The government could make law to forbid smoking in restaurants. And it warn smoking will effect yourself and another people's health. It will many good aspects to life. In a word, Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in China."
383,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Although smoking is an unhealthy living habit and many people see it as a social cancer which threats both the smokers themselves and other people's health, banning smoking in all the restaurants is quite unnecessary and irrational. On one hand, if this practice targets at encouraging more and more smokers to quit smoking, that would be too strict. Quit smoking is a long and bitter process, it's impossible for those smokers to make it overnight, banning smoking in restaurants makes their life not convenient and may hurt their feelings because I think restaurants should be a place to relax, where many people ease their pressure by enjoying smoking. On the other hand, if restaurants aim at protecting other costumers' health, complete banning on smoking is not necessary at all. Like the minority of restaurants in the world, we can separate smokers from ordinary costumers and place them in an independent kitchen. To conclude, although smoking is not welcomed in public places, we can make it too strict. However, we can set some rules to limit them, but not totally ban smoking."
100,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In recent years, we see more and more people smoke everywhere in public places like street, supermarkets, restaurants, and so on. Some people think we should ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country. Opinions of whether it should be banned in restaurants vary from person to person. First of all, as far as we know, smoking is bad for our health; Health body is our capital for struggling live, if we don't have healthy body, how can we live our life to the full? So you eat and smoke together in the restaurants, it is very harmful. More importantly, if you smoking in restaurant, it will influence other people where closed to you, these people who will have an uncomfortable feeling while he smelled this taste. They come to restaurants to have a good meal, not to smell cigarette smoke. We must put other's thoughts in our hearts, and can't leave the public behind. Most important, some people think that restaurants are comfortable places for those people who are busy all the days around. But the thoughts of others who can't live with smokes can't be over emphasized. Perhaps, to solve this issue is not easy at all, but it's worth trying. We should do our best, such as hold a speech in public announce that the disadvantage for smoking or do some more Public service advertising to improve the present situation. The government set a rule to force people smoke outside of the restaurants. I do believe it will be better in the future."
367,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Today, smoking is a widely spread habit among all the people. A few years ago, only adults smoke. But now, not only adults but also teenagers smoke. And people start smoking in more and more places. But many people are tired of this. So should smoking be banned? The answer is yes. For example, if you smoke in restaurant, you will pollute the air. Others will inbreathe the polluted air and it is harmful to their health. And the polluted air will also do harm to you. And smoking will produce a bad smell. It will make others dislike you. It will also harm to the restaurant. And smoking in other public places should also be banned. If you smoke in an Internet bar, the smell will be attached to everything in the bar. Breathing will be difficult in the bar. The next to come will feel bad when surfing the Internet. The lungs of everyone will be damaged by the smell. The most important thing is that the air will be polluted and it will influence the health of everyone. As you know, when you smoke, it will be more harmful to others who breathe in the smell. In my opinion, people should give up smoking. Smoking is harmful to not only the people but also the environment. Giving up smoking is equal to taking care of others and the environment."
101,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Have you ever met the situation that when you are enjoying the delicious food in a restaurant, suddenly the boring smoke flies into your noses It becomes much common to see people smoking in the restaurant, which often make non-smokers lose their appetite and feel annoyed to inhale second-hand smoke?On account that cigarette could help people eliminate the feeling of loneliness and depression temporarily, more and more people begin to smoke. According to the survey, there are a large number of people smoking among every age. We cannot prevent everyone from smoking, but we need to exert ourselves to protect people who don't smoke from breathing in the polluted air which attributes to the smokers. We all know what's in second-hand smoke, and also first-hand smoke for the smokers. Cigarette is poisonous. Nicotine in it is a drug, so is the carbon monoxide from smoke. People who smoke would in all probability suffer from a variety of diseases and die prematurely. The second-hand smoke is fatal to us the same as the first-hand smoke, perhaps even more harmful. For the benefit of non-smokers, smoking should be regulated in public places, especially in the restaurant. The smelly smoke not only ruins what could be a dainty morsel but also destroy people's health. Before we can advise all the smokers to abstain from smoking, I think there is absolutely no doubt that smoking should be banned in the restaurant in the country."
255,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿For what reasons do we go in to university? Some students are gifted talents in science, and they love academic research out of nature and want to spend their life in this honorable thing. But for most of us, we go to schools because we want a promising future. Because of this motivation, we come to university for higher education, to prepare for our coming career. So, if we want to learn some survival skills in college, then it is important for us to take a part time job outside the campus. Here are some reasons below. First and foremost, what we learn in schools are just some theories. Only after we apply them in social practice can we properly handle them. So part time job will help us enhance our college performance. As for me, a student with major in finance, I really want an internship of famous accounting companies, like the winter internship of ****. After working in such a company, I would have a better idea of what I am interesting in and what is needed much attention in my study process. Secondly, doing part time job will provide one with better preparation in his future career and make him more competent in the job interviewing. Companies would always like applicant with professional experience. It is because the part time job would not only equip him with professional knowledge, but also make him more mature and more dependable. In conclusion, a part time job is much meaningful to a student who wants to make advanced preparation for career. The part time job will enhance his academic performance and expand the professional experience as well."
032,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As college students, we leave our hometown and go to new places to study. Also, we try our best to live on our own feet. In this case, many students apply for part time jobs to support themselves. So does the time spent on part time jobs really deserve?On one hand, the advantages stand out. Through part time job, students can get some money for school and daily life. And to students in need of money, it is just necessary. Then students can get good experience both academically and socially. With more contact to the society, students learn more about out-school life. What's more, part-time job helps students develop good working habits and communicating skills that are really useful for future work. On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages; first, inexperienced job-hunting may bring students artificial information and waste money and confidence. Then the second disadvantage is that many students spend too much time working so that they leave behind others in studies. To conclude, every coin has its two sides. So is the part-time job. If we deal with it carefully, we care sure to make the most of it. My personal idea is to take suitable part-time job when you really need or want to gain experience. But everybody has his own situation, so just do not follow others blindly."
254,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. No matter how good it is to take a part-time job for a college student, his first duty is study. Someone think that they can learn more knowledge in a part-time job, but not everyone can pay the time and energy. I strongly believe only the students who have the ability to do well in their class can have a part-time job. For most college student, it is not an easy thing to grasp all the knowledge that they must know. If these students just think have a part-time is important and use up their time to do the job, how can they to be good students? Having a part-time job just like a lesson which you can take if you are full of energy, but it is not important for college students. It can teach you something you can't learn from our books, but it can also fill your heart with something like anger, hatred and so on. To early to have a job, even a part-time job, has no good for a student. Even most college students has been adult, they are too young to have a real job. To make a long story short, I think it is not important for college students to have a part-time job."
192,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know that smoking does harm to our health. The topic 'Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country?' is so hot. In my opinion, the answer is yes. Obviously, smoking is bad for our health. Some smokers, however, like to smoke in public places, such as in the restaurant. When they are smoking in the restaurant, not only themselves, but also others will be infected. If smoking is allowed in the public places, the person who does not smoke will be infected and then they will be sick. At the same time, study shows that smoking does bigger harm to their health. This is unfair. On the other hand, smoking will pollute the air and the environment. You should know that smoking is dangerous. When you go to a restaurant, you will find that the table, table cloth and so on which are damaged by smoking. You can find holes in them. So you should understand the effects. We have a conscience by nature. So we cannot be selfish. Finally, it is a good idea to ban smoking in public places and in the restaurant because a ban can reduce conflicts and does less harm to human beings' health. At the same time, the environment we live in will be protected. Everyone can do it immediately."
193,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is well known that restaurants are public places, while smoking is a personal preference. There is no doubt that smoking should be banned in all public places including restaurants all over our country. First of all, smoking is harm to our health. There are a lot of evidences and studies showing that many diseases are caused by smoking, such as lung cancer, heart trouble, and so on. What's worse, it will also do harm to the nonsmokers who are around you in the restaurant. In addition, smoking may probably cause security incidents. There have been lots of fire disasters causing by smoking in recent years. Some smokers throw the burning cigarette here and there. It will not only cause great loss, but also destroy the environment. It really does harm to our society and security It is hard to force some smokers who consider smoking a part of their life to give up smoking. They rely on cigarette, and think that smoking can relieve their innate anxiety. To solve this problem, setting a special room for smokers in public places is acceptable. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all public places. In order to take care of yourself, you had better give up smoking and advise the smokers around you to give up smoking."

It is related to the idea that building a healthy and clearly environment in public places in our country. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. On one hand, as we all known, smoking is bad for our health, no matter we are smoker or people who don't smoke but breathe the smoke in the air. The harmful things in cigarette are not only do harm to our lungs but also our brains. To keep our body more health, we should not smoke. On the other hand, restaurants are public places, a large number of people eat meat in there every day. For us who extremely don't like smell the flavor of smoking, it is a loathed thing that smells the smoke. And it is harmful to our health, especially to the children. What's more, a survey shows that if people smoke when they are eating the bad effect will enormously than other times. So we should forbid smoking at all the restaurants. Since that case, I believe that it is a good thing to ban smoking at the restaurants in the country. Because not only us dislike smoking but also the smokers will benefit a lot from it. And it can also help those people who want to give up smoking to keep away from the cigarette."

There is no doubt that the desire to make something meaningful is in everyone'mind. We want to prove ourselves and make values through our best trying. One of the disadvantages of taking part-time jobs is we may not focus on our study. Part-time jobs exactly makes us useful and powerful, but out major tadget is not in that. We must put our study in the first place, then we can have some activities, jobs or joys in the spare time. Moreover, stepping society brings us lots of bad habits. We fix an eye on the materials, However, every coin has two sides. Part-time jobs bring us lots of opportunities, plenty of convenience and amounts of abilities if we deal with them well. Many students who have no part-time working experience can't adapt to the society. We also get some basic skills and whenever we are we have advantages. On the whole, part-time jobs can bring us good as long as we arrange our time well and have a clear understanding on our future life. Everything is not as it seems.

As the status of woman now is promoted in present-day society, they can smoke like men and even regard smoking as the symbol of fashion. What's more, smoking is becoming popular among many young persons. At any places, the smoking persons can be seen any places. However, as to me, it's an ugly behavior especially in public places, such as restaurants. I advocate that smoking should completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking has a serious bad effect on our health. Cigarettes contain various poisonous elements which can be deadly in some degree. If somebody is addicted to it, his body will be exhausted gradually. In public, most of people want to live in harmonious environment and don't hope to be surrounded by smog which is spread by smokers. The smog can be breathed in by others who stay beside the smokers and have no habit to smoke. At this time, it does more harm than the smokers. Furthermore, many people will have a headache or have no appetite on food when smog fills the air at restaurants. When the rest of a cigarette is thrown down with going out, it may cause a fire. To create harmonious environment at restaurant, to appreciate the delicious food, to care about the health of your friends and families, please stop smoking."

Others are eager to develop the ability needed in possible future work. Still others who have no clear purpose don't want to be different from the students as a part-time worker, so they join them. It's important for college students to have a part-time job, however, not necessary. Suppose a student, whose family is able to afford the study, is determined to hold the Doctor degree, he should concentrate on the study, paying little attention to something else. Generally speaking, having a part-time job is important. Part-time jobs offer students chances to go out of campus, knowing more about the society and also, provide college students with the plat form to show and develop their ability in a further step. Part-time jobs, to some degree, enable college students to make full use of their time, preventing them from addicting to something else, for example, the online game. In the same time, students can experience the coming life in advance and for most ones, will own the first income. Even themselves can't describe the feeling when they get the small sum of money in common. Part-time job is indeed important for college students."

Above all, taking a part-time job will undoubtedly occupy a lot of time which should be spent on study, leading to a negative effect on our major mission, study. Take my classmate ****** for example. He take a part-time job as a guard out of curiousity. At first, he was fond of it. However, with the increase of classes, he discovered that he had to set aside too much time for the part-time job decreasing his study quality. Now, he wanted to get rid of it. So it is concluded that taking a part time job is bad to our study. However, some of my friends hold the view that it is necessary for college students take part-time job for the reason that it is not only a good way of increasing our income but also good experience. Nevertheless, I disagree with it. First, a college student has to spend 500 RMB per month. Taking a part-time job can only bring 50 RMB per month. It is not worth of spending so much time. Secondly, we should acquire in college is kowledge not work experience. After graduate, we have a lot of time to get work experience and little time to study. It is obvious that it is better to study now and take a job in the future. So, the opinion that part-time job is necessary for college students is wrong. In short, I believe that part-time job is not necessary for college students."
173,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Today, in many countries, it is widely accepted that college students are engaged in some kind of paid work. Therefore, many college students find part-time jobs which they are interested in. However, as for this phenomenon, opinions vary from person to person. Some people are in favor of the idea that they consider it as valuable work experience and important for learning and taking responsibility. Also it can help the college students understand the world. They will know how difficult to own money and why we need to save money in our daily lives. When they face the hardship during the working time, maybe there is nobody is willing to help you, you only overcome it by yourself. It will help the college students to be brave. Some people are opposed of the idea that they think college students are so young that they cannot work without the help of their parents. What is more, crime rates have been on the rise over the years, it is not safe that college students work outside. From my perspective, it is not necessarily sensible for college student's work. The college students need to study. If they work, they will have little time to review what they have learnt in schools. I do not agree with college student's work outside."
227,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I consider that smoking in the public is having a worse and worse influence on the society. Although cigarettes help a lot on the economy of a country, I still suggest that it must be banned in public. Many people around us have developed the habit of smoking and some of them are even addictted to it. However, as is known to all, smoking influences ones' health, and always smoking is just like killing themselves. People who smoke are more possibly to get a cancer and some related diseases. So, for the sake of one's family, people should learn to quit smoking right now. Moreover, the tobacco will produce lots of harmful and poisonous smoke. The gas has an unpleasant smell and make people feel unwell. There is no denying that the inhalation of second-hand smoke is harmful to people health. Furthermore, environment will be affected by the smoke realeased by cigarettes. The air quality in the city would decline. You can always find that many cigarettes ends was thrown on the streets. It was not good for the development of the city. In a word, smoking in the public may meet the needs of some people, but it has many disadvantages to the whole city. People should consciously do not smoke."
040,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Obviously, burning cigarettes damage smoker's health, and second-hand smoking is harmful to nonsmokers. So, holding the opinion that it is unfair for nonsmokers, some people claim that smoking should be quit in public places like restaurant in our country entirely. To be honest, I can't concede them anyway. Undoubtedly, as a nonsmoker, it is annoying to see other people smoking beside you. But for a smoker, when they lit up a cigarette in restaurant, a waiter come and politely ask him to smoking outside, he can also be irritated. People should have same right, despite whether he smokes or not. People have their right to smoke, just like they have their right do not smoke. We can't only consider one group people, but we should take them all in count. So, banning smoking in restaurant is greeting by people hate cigarettes, but it is unacceptable to smokers. Is there a compromising solution exist to let everyone satisfied? Of course, setting a smoking area is the simplest idea. It can solve the problem in a simple and inexpensive way. So why we should ban smoking in restaurant? I know that is many country of the world, smoking is not allowed in public places. For example, in Italy, smoking is not allowed in any place except private dwelling. And adults smoking in public places will have a pattern to children and teenagers. But we should make children know smoking is not good through teaching, not by making smokers invisible. I still believe that people have their right to smoke, and public should give them the convenience to smoke. From what I have mentioned above, it is not difficult to have this summary that smoking shouldn't be banned in restaurants."
320,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Now many college students want to have a part-time job. But is it important for them to do a part-time job? Some people may think it is vital for them to know more about the society. However, in my opinion, I don't agree with this. I think it is not quite important. Firstly, the reason that so many students want to do the part-time job may be is just that they want to make money by themselves and have more experience. They may work in some fast food restaurant. And the pay is not very high. The part-time job can occupy a lot of their time. So it is not good for their study. Some jobs may ask them to work at night and it is harmful to their health. Secondly, as a college student, the major of the duties is to learn the knowledge. Actually, most of the college students have no special ability or techniques, so their jobs mostly are likely to be waiters or something else that can't help them to improve their professional skills. Thirdly, because the jobs are not close to their professional knowledge and the jobs are somewhat tired and the payis low, they maybe lose heart. In fact, a lot of universities have provided students with many chances to take part in practice. The practice not only won't occupy a lot of time, but also give students enough experience. In short, if one has a lot of free time, he or she can do a part-time job. But it is not important or necessary for college students to do it."
389,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is a harmful habit that does no good to either the smoker or the people around. As is known, smoking makes it easier for people to get many kinds of diseases especially the cancer. As health is so important to human beings, we should abandon the bad habit using any available way. Secondly, smoking would make the eating environment much less enjoyable. Supposing you are having a delicious salad on a fresh spring morning, and the scent of the flowers is wafted along by the breeze. You start to breath greedily, but that's the moment when someone begins to smoke. You'll be choked and then physically and mentally nauseous. Since many people in the restaurant are sharing the same bad feeling with you, it's necessary that smoking become totally banned at all the restaurants as soon as possible. Thirdly, the restaurant is a specific kind of public area, where people meet and influence each other. In that sense, smoking may affect many curious teenagers or kids who cannot distinguish right from wrong. If they go astray because of having watched too many brilliant adults smoking in the restaurant, our society would have to take the inescapable responsibility of misleading them to do so. In a word, cigarettes should not be accepted by all restaurants for nobody could afford the grave consequences it leads to."
147,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, many students use their spare time to take a part-time job, it has become a trend. As a college student, to this kind of phenomenon I have some different views. I think, a part-time job, fully take advantage of our spare time, make our college life becomes rich rise. Meanwhile, we can slowly learned independent, and realize make money is not easily. So, we can learn save money. Additionally, we can make money by ourselves. This is a good way to alleviate the burden of our parents. Finally, the experience we gain through part-time jobs may be of grate help to our future career. Undeniable, part-time job also has some shortcomings. First, as college students, we should put study in the first place. Part-time job will be taking up the time for our study; we will not have enough energy to busy with our study. As a result, we may fail in our school study, which will affect our future career. Everyone has his own ideas. For this shouldn't do a part-time job, every college students have their own opinions. We should according to the circumstance of oneself make decisions. If you think that you can handle the relationship between work and study, so you can try bravely. Anyway, learning is the most important thing in our life at present; we should focus on our study."
213,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In my opinion, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in China. Firstly, smoking is bad for our body, because it can damage many organs. It is known that many of people get ill because of it, and some of the diseases even cannot be cured, as a result, what is waiting for them is death. Secondly, smoking is not only bad for smokers but for people around them. Scientists have shown that the most serious victims are people around you when you smoking, because the most polluted air is smoked by them not you. Maybe many of people are surprise at the fact and cannot believe it, but it is the truth. Thirdly, if we have realized the badness of smoking and have decided to ban smoking, the government should do a favour so that restaurants all over the country can ban it together. The reason is that if only a few restaurants did it, people who like smoking will think that it were strange or unfair. As a result, they may choose another restaurant that does not ban it, instead. After a long time, banning smoking restaurants may give up, because their customs are decreasing, and what they have done is in vain. In a word, smoking is bad for not only you but me. It is better to ban it not only in restaurants but in anywhere."
212,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Where there is air, there is smoking. Though the terrible effect of smoking is already known to every adolescence and adult, there is never a trend that smoking will disappear. Yet, we should still insist that less smoking is better for our life after thinking about why the trend exists. The very first step is again to speak medical side effects of smoking. Not only will smoking will damage the lung tissue in the body, the polluted air, which contains nicotine, further interferes the persons around the smoker. The second-handed smoke now has been proved to be more harmful. We could say that if the legal system were more strict, the smoker could have been sued for millions times. But why there is no trend that smoking will disappear?  Firstly, it is because of the extravagant profit from the cigarette industry. As it is the retained profit for those cigarette companies, there is rare chance that they will give up the opportunities to earn the money. Secondly, the customers will use the cigarettes as gifts so that they can show their preference for others. Some will also think the cigarettes symbolise their social status. In another word, the market of cigarette trade still maintains intact. Thirdly, smokers will just get addicted to smoking—that is the most troublesome. As long as these reasons exist, the people's life will be affected for one more day, and more happiness will be deprived of. So, let's act to reduce the use of cigarette, and there will be less annoyance resulting from smoking."
281,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Many countries made a law, which is forbid to smoking in the all restaurants Though I agree with the government, I think it can not solve this situation. it is not a great way to solve. Smoking frog is harmful to our body, not only the smokers, but also the people who stand around him or her in some public places, Especially in the restaurants. If someone smokes, the air will be polluted. So many people breathe the frog, which is bad for their lungs and will influence people's moods. In my opinion, the measure is not suitable, those smokers need to smoke, they need a place to smoke in the public place, and we can correct it. For example, we can set a smoking room in order to their needs. In the world we must treat everyone equally. Though we hate smoking, Someone who be addicted to smoking need to smoke, they can not stop smoking right now, if you do not let they smoke, they will be hurried. Nowadays we must treat them with love, we need to think about in the other hand. In this way, we can solve this problem better. So I believe the world will be in concordance."
229,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Nowadays more and more college students take up part time jobs in their spare time, as far as I am concerned, it does much good to the students and they should be encouraged to do so. The reasons are as follows. First of all, we students may get some amount of money by doing part time jobs. The money is important not only because we can purchase something, but also the fact that we learn how hard it is to earn money. Then we will understand our parents and make full use of our pocket money. Secondly, by doing part time jobs, we get a lot of experience that we will never learn about in our classes. As for our students, there is little time for us to know about the society. However, part time job provides us with the chance and we get the experience in time. Then we have the advantage over others who have no access to part time jobs. Last but not least, doing part time job is meaningful because we are able to put theories into practice. For example, for a student who is major in mechanic engineering. If he only learns theories, he will not have a good command of it. Only by doing part time job and explore the work on his own can he really understand his major. So in a word, doing part time job is pretty good and we college students should be encouraged to do so."
095,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, there is a heated debating about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Different people hold the different opinions. You cannot image how terrible it is for a college student to have a part-time job, people who object to the opinion emphasize this. From the point of their view, it is the course-studying that we college students should concentrate on and doing a part-time job wastes plenty of our time, what is worse, what it brings us in wealthy is far less than what it takes us in time and knowledge. They also assume that we will earn more in future in return once we contribute all of our time to studying during college, it's a further investment. While, when it comes to the topic, the others put the great agreement on college students to have a part-time job. They stress that no matter how rich or poor we are, we should go for a job in college, and it's not a matter of earning money, but an opportunity to close to society. What's more, it's not merely for us students to accumulate the experience, but a chance to apply what we learn in class to the reality. Taking part-time jobs will obviously do much good to student; it's not a waste of time, not to speak to the short-sighted. What is known to used all is that every coin has two sides, but as to have a part-time job, I think, we students benefit from it more than what we lose from it, and what the society really needs is　typed talent, but not the ones who can recite a great many articles, who can tell a quantity of theories, or who can just write a pile of useless papers."
094,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ The question whether college student have a part-time job becomes a hot topic nowadays. Everybody has different opinions. Let's think about what we can get from having a part-time job. Of course we can acquire a lot of experiences and get some extra money to improve our life in college. On the contrary, what do we lose when we have a part-time job? We will lose many time and energy. And it may be influence our study. So I don't think there is a certain answer to the question mentioned above because each student has different situation. To some students whose family lack richness, they may have to have a part-time job to afford their tuition and even help their family to improve life level. It is important to these students who want to have a job after college to have a part-time job in college for they need abundant experience. There are some other students who want to continue studying domestic or go abroad after school. Maybe it is not that much important to them to have a part-time job. For these students, what they should do first is studying well. In a word, college life should be rich and colorful; studying is not the only goal that every student has. We should read more valuable books and learn more skills. If we have more spare time, we can think about having a part-time job. Whatever, we should not waste our precious college life."
368,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is important for college students to have a part-job in my eyes. As you know, nowadays students in college almost are the 90s. They are almost born in a peaceful and wealthy family. However, the stabilized living circumstance makes their lazy and irresponsible. So when they are now in school, they are always staying in their living room and never go out for one step, which is called otaku by society. They don't want to take a part-job, neither. As far as I am concerned, there are some students taking a part-job, who are almost come from a relatively ""poor"" family, such as me. Taking a part-job is important for us, because it can give a sum of money, which though not large, can loosen our parents' pressure and make us feel comfortable when we think our parents won't live in a tense life. Maybe it is not important for some students. In my eyes, except a small income, there is an important reason to take a part-job in college. Now I have been taking two part-jobs, where I find much happiness. In the team, I have made many friends. We together work, and live. During our teamwork, I learned how to be a good teammate and how to cooperate with others in a task. I love my part-job and love my teammates. It is important to take a part-job. Hi, friends, do you listen me! Come to join us. You are welcome!"
352,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ All of us have been told that smoking is bad for health. Many kinds of harmful components are found in the smoke including carbon monoxide, tar, heavy metal and many kinds of substances. But still there are a lot of men smoking and more and more women are becoming smokers. Some people smoke just because they are sometimes embraced because when people pass them cigarettes by courtesy. And some just consider smoking as a cool act. But most people start smoke because of pressure. The have got too much work deep into the night, many of them smoke to defend drowsiness. Some of them smoke to get rid of pressure and annoyance. Maybe people just smoke for some important purpose at first, but soon they won't help but smoking out of habit. I don't think people should smoke in public, not only because smoking is bad for their health but also smoking harms other people. The smoke smokers breathe out and the smoke from the burning part is even more poisonous than the gas they breathe in. It harms many other people present who are not smoking. And the smell is definitely smoky. The best way to get rid of smoking is never taste it. One should choose better ways to get rid of pressure and drowsiness. And besides, smoking is not cool at all indeed!"
135,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, in need of business communication, many people select to smoking in the restaurant; but I don't support this action. In my view, smoking should thoroughly be banned in the restaurant. I consider that there will be a majority of people standing on my side. At first, smoking does harm to personnel's health. It can damage human's immerse system and lead to life span's decreasing. Then, I think it is uncivilized behavior to smoking in the restaurant; especially when others are eating, your this behavior will influence others' emotion. Perhaps you will say it's interactive necessity; but I think you can entirely use wine instead of smoking, at least it won't influence the atomaspher's quality so as to effect others' emotion. At last, cigarette is easy to cause a fire if you throw it anywhere with dimming it out. In totally, smoking in the restaurant has one hundred harms but without one advantage. In addition, I really hate someone who smoke in the restaurant very much. This behavior will lead to my appitate's losing. As a result of this, I strongly reject this behavior that people smoke in the restaurant. Your action isn't your single one's action and it will influence others. Therefore, I suggest that smoking be completely banned in the restaurant."
007,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There are no complete agreements among the students about the view about whether we should take part-time job. Many students hold the opinion that we should have part-time jobs. However, also there are a lot of them having a different view. The people who hold the first view think it is helpful and wise to take part-time jobs. Firstly, they think they can develop their experience and capacities during working. It is obvious that this can make preparations for the job in the future. Second, they can get money on their own, cultivating their independence and skill. Finally, they can contract a lot of people and learn from them what cannot be taught in the school. But the people who take the second view don't think so, they think it's not suit for students to do part-time jobs. Students' primary task is to study, without being worsted in the knowledge which they should gain in the school; they may lose the opportunity of finding a better job after graduation. So it is not right for them to spend their energy and time on part-time job. Weighing the two kinds of views, I think it is beneficial for us to try part-time jobs but not putting all the time and energy on it."
260,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Absolutely, it is necessary. There are many advantages for us who take part-time jobs. First of all, as a college student, we do not have any income. So a part-time job can bring us more freedom on shopping on our own. For example, a friend of mine is on a work-study programme, every month she gets one hundred and fifty Yuan. As a result, she can use her own money to buy her favourite things or things she needs. What is more, she feels happy when she uses the money which comes from her own labour. Second, a part-time job can bring us working experience, which we merely have but all companies attach importance to. It is also the most important reason. There are more and more college students every year hunting for jobs. Companies value working experience specially. So it is more and more essential to gain more experience. Last, we can grow up through a part-time job. If we meet difficulties, we must learn how to solve them. That is a process of growing, too. As the old saying goes ""No pains, no gains"". By taking part-time jobs, college students can learn a lot that cannot exist on textbooks or classroom. As college students take more part-time jobs, they have a better chance to know what the society is like, and adapt to the shift in society easily. According to all these reasons, we can draw a conclusion that part-time job is necessary for college students. It is obvious that college students can benefit great from part-time jobs."
284,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I am in favor of the topic that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. My reasons are as follows. First, nowadays many college students have little knowledge on social-living skills during to the one-child policy, so even though they are riched in textbook knowledge they won't adjust to the real future society. Part-time job is a good choice to solve it, it can teach them how to deal with various problems when they are working with others. Second, during part-time job, students will work on their on their own and be paid according to how much they have done, so they will understand how hard money comes and be more grateful for what they have. Third, on the period of working, college students will make known of many people, they work together, eat together and may even play toghther, they will achieve more happiness during working and their lives will be enriched. Part-time jobs have a lot of advantages that be good for us students. However, part-time job isn't the only way that can achieve these. We students can take more activities, join more organizations and do more meaningful things. On this way, I believe we college students will have a bright future."
285,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Many college students spend their free time in doing part-time jobs. And it has also become a kind of fashion. I think students do part-time jobs mainly for three reasons. First, some students do part-time jobs for money so that their material demand can be satisfied better. In this case, I don't think part-time job is necessary for students who already have a high living standard. To those students, part-time jobs may stimulate their desire for material things, and may ruin their study eventually. However, a proper part-time job will be good for students whose families are not wealthy enough to support them. I believe making money by themselves will make them feel good, and they may live a better life. Social experience is another reason. As we all know that most of us will face to the social after our graduation. By that time, it'll be hard for us to make a live only depend on what we've learnt in school. That is to say, social experience is also very important. We should know how this society works and how to meet the demand of the society. In this case, doing part-time jobs is a good way to learn about the society. By working with people outside school, students can gain a lot of social experience, which will lay a great impact on their future. There are also some students do part-time jobs only because they are interested in it. What they care about is not their pay but the fun they get during the part-time job. I think they should be encouraged if they really enjoy their part-time jobs. They can having fun, and even prove themselves. All in all, I think part-job should be encouraged as long as students' study is not affected by it. To those students who have spare time, doing part-time jobs is no doubt a good opportunity to learn something that can't be taught in campus."
178,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In recent years, more and more college students choose to take part-time jobs in or outside school. Many teachers complain that there are fewer and fewer students who pay attention to their study. Should we put the blame on part-time jobs? Is it a good thing for college students to work part time? I think we need to think about this question carefully from different sides. It is true that excellent academic: qualifications are something essential if you want to find a good job after you leave school. But on the other hand, for those who can easily get high marks in examinations, it is worth trying to find something to do in their spare time. Then they can get some work experience which is as valuable as their academic achievement. From what I have said, it is difficult to judge whether taking part time jobs is good or bad. It depends on how you deal with the relationship between working and learning. If you can balance it well, you are sure to get enough knowledge as well as working experience, so as to get ready for you future success. So we can just say that doing part-time job can be good for some people and not so good for others. It just depends on your situations."
179,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is popular to take a part-time job for college students. Young people at college have begun to have a new notion of learning, the content of which includes not only book knowledge, but also social knowledge and independence. Taking part-time job offers a good option. So it is important to take a part-time job for college students. There are many advantages for college students. Firstly, part-time jobs will provide a chance to broaden our horizon. Thus our college life is not boring. Because students can meet different people and can learn a lot from them. Secondly, some jobs, such as a family tutor, are different from other part-time jobs, these jobs doesn't only help others' study, but also assure the students themselves review the knowledge that has been told. Instead, taking part-time job, the college students can make some money to buy something that they have wanted for a long time rather than ask for their parents. Last but not least, through the part-time, the college students can feel independent and can realize that they have become mature. Because they can make the parents' financial burden relieved. After all, if they get a good salary, they own are able to afford the tuition. To sum up, taking a part-time job can train college students how to better learn understand life and has many advantages. So it is important to take a par-time job for college students."
143,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ You can see many people smoking at everywhere, on the road, in the subway, and in the restaurants. I think smoking should be banned at public place, especially at all the restaurant. In the first place, restaurants is public place, and there are many people stay in a almost closed place, which cause the air in the restaurant isn't very fresh. Moreover, Somking will make this condition even worse. Everyone knows the harmfulness of the second-hand smoking, especially to the pregnant woman, so I against smoking in the restaurant firmly. Secondly, smoking is a kind of addiction, if someone pick out a cigarette and want smoke, someone else who see this can't help smoking. And it's very normal when a person want to smoking, he will invite others smoke with him. People around then will feel being disturbed when they are making smoke. In my opinion, government and the restaurants should associate to ban the people who smoke in the restaurant. They can make a signal in the noticed place, and smoking person can go to someplace private, like washroom. In a word, smoking isn't a good hobby, and I think it's really a disturbing thing when a person smoking in the restaurant. So I think it's really necessary to ban smoking in the restaurant."
142,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Some people think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I agree with it. There are some reasons to support my idea. In Chinese traditional custom, many people getting together are a pleasure, especially in a restaurant. However, the reality is that many people smoke in restaurants. Then people feel uncomfortable because others smoke in the restaurants. In my opinion, as a public place, restaurants are opening for every customer who wants to spend money on meal. So if one is smoking in a restaurant may annoy others, it is not a good idea for the boss to allow this action's existing. On other hand, many people who hate smoking may feel sick when they smell smoke so that they cannot enjoy their meal. For a long time, there will be no customers' presenting in the restaurant. That will be a big loss for the restaurant. If it becomes more serious, some customers may get disease even by having second-hand smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in a restaurant, as far as I am concerned, is not a polite behavior. So smoking in public should be banned and smoking in restaurants should be banned too."
070,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Recently, more and more college students have a part time job when their time is vacant. I partly support that it is important for college students to have a part time job. In my opinion, college students become more independent and have more free time. Some college students spend a lot of time in online games. Instead of this, students could look for a part time job. It can make most use of their time and their lives could be more interesting. Finding a part time job can also let us know the difficulties from employment and adapt ourselves to society. And when we are working, we can learn some special skills and knowledge which we are not able to get access to in our college. We could develop our ability through the part-time job. For example, we can become considerable and careful if we take a job as a waiter or waitress. Personally speaking, as college students, we should try to get into the society around us, because we become adults at the same time. So there is no doubt that taking a part job is a shortcut. We can gain some unforgettable experience form it. So if you have time, try to look for a part-time job."
131,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Facing today's tough job market, it is high time that college students should have a part-time job. I have the following reasons for my opinion:Firstly, having a part-time job will give you a lot of work experience. Getting a job can give you a lot of experience. If you have a part-time job when you are studying in the college, you can learn more knowledge and it will make you become excellent for future job. College students can practice their school knowledge if they do a part-time job. Secondly, college students can benefit from doing part-time job by earning money from it. Then it can less your parents' shoulders of some financial pressure. You cannot depend on your parents forever. We can learn to depend on ourselves gradually. If you try to do this early, you will find it easy to become independent one day. Thirdly, part-time job is a good chance to develop our character and help us face pressure. There are many work pressure from doing different kind part-time job. Then you find it not difficult for your real job. Above all, we can draw a conclusion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
199,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿We do know that smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Every year, millions of people die of lung cancers due to smoking. Smoking is damaging people every day. Yet, smoking should not be banded completely at all the restaurants in China. My views are as follows. Things that exist must have values. In China's long history, smoking dates back to centuries ago. There must be reasons why so many people smoke. Smoking can make people have a good break after exhausting physical work. Also, many women say that they feel safe when they smoke. Artists say that they have flash ideas when they smoke. Writers also say they can not write down any word without smoking. Many people also have the habit of smoking during meals. If people can not drop the habit, why not produce cigarettes with higher qualities? It will be harmless of they don't breathe in the toxic nicotine. Smoking should be reduced but not banned completely. Many people say they can not do anything without cigarettes. Thus, it will not be a good idea to ban smoking. People who smoke during meals will feel that nothing is tasty if they are banned smoking. It would be better that we accept that fact and think of ways to solve the problem. In summary, banning smoking is not the only way to solve problems. Change an angle to think. Producing better and healthier cigarettes way be of vital importance."
130,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As is known to us all, many college students choose to take a part-time job in their spare time and this is a common phenomenon in our life. But here we need to talk about whether part-time job could actually do good to our college students. As far as I am concerned, I believe that taking a part-time job certainly brings about several advantages. First of all, when we take a job, we could get a chance to learn to be independent. In the same time, we can use this chance to try to get along with others. What is more, as result, we can also get our financial reward and work experience as well which may be helpful in our future life. Furthermore, to take a part-time job provides us with an important opportunity to put what we have learnt from books into practice. However, every coin has two sides. There are also some disadvantages. Firstly, some students may spend a lot of time doing part-time jobs so that they just neglect their studies and this will affect their studies as a result. Secondly, some students may be cheated by others, because they don't know how to take good care of themselves and how to distinguish between right and wrong. In a word, I agree that students should try to get a part-time job which could help them to know something about society, but they should keep a balance between job and study."
002,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I somewhat disagree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. As is well known, smoking is a killer of humans'health, which does great harm to our breath systems and finally makes our bodies weak. And what makes matters worse; most healthy people dislike the smell of smoking, which is not only the matter the citizens care about but also the matter that affects the whole impression of the place. So we could safely come to the conclusion that smoking is harmful to everyone eager for health and honor except for the factories making out the cigars and alike. However, even though smoking is hateful, we'd better say that we should try to control it not to ban it, or we would be subjective. For one thing, part of people here couldn't give it up right away for smoking is the comfort in their lives. It's obvious that if one could live longer without emotion and happiness, he might prefer to choose a shorter life with happiness. So we shouldn't kill people's happiness at the moment except when we find something else to replace it and they are willing to accept. For another, restaurants are the places where the citizens experience life and relax themselves. Many are accustomed to smoke there. As we see, having a smoke in an ordinary restaurant is like a function of the restaurant itself. From the above, we could get to know that smoking could not be completely banned in the restaurants in the country. However, we might find other ways to improve the environment we live in. For example, there could be restaurants and other public places alike especially for smoking, where you could smoke as you like without any limitation."
264,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As we all know, smoking does harm to our health. It's harmful not only to smokers. The cigarette smoke is also bad for non-smokers. So in many cities, smoking is forbidden in public places. As for restaurants, I think it's better to set up non-smoking and smoking zones than forbidden it strictly. Smoking has proved to be closely linked to many diseases such as cancer, heart problems. It's really unfair for non-smokers to be harmed by cigarette smoke. Since smoking is addictive, most smokers find it difficult to give up smoking although they know its harm. They may feel uncomfortable if not allowed to smoke. However, we must ensure that the health of non-smokers is not damaged. In my view, setting up smoking and non-smoking zones is a good way to solve the problem when taking the interests of both sides into account. Nowadays more and more people recognize the dangers of smoking. There are many kinds of publicities against smoking such as World No-Tobacco Day. There are also agencies to help people quit smoking. We will learn more about the dangers of smoking by those publicities and assistance. I hope there will be fewer and fewer smokers and whether to forbidden smoking in restaurants will not be a problem anymore one day because there are no cigarettes in the world."
265,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As the number of the smokers coming up, more and more public place are surrounded by smoke. In my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public place. As we know, smoking does harm to the smokers, and smoking is able to make a healthy man go to death. But what many people don't know is that the second smoking does much more harm to the people who don't smoke. And it means that all the people who stay in the public places where there are smokers will get bad influence. Pubulic place is that everyone can stay in. So it should be O. K to everyone. For our health, we should forbid people smoking in public place. Public place should be beautuful and be comfortable. But smoking can make much smoke make much smoke which is smell bad surround the public place. So it will be made incomfortable. And many people maybe get away because of the smoke. Public places are for everyone. For the beauty of the public place, we should forbid people smoking in public place. So I think we should forbid people smoking in public place. We need a beautful and comfortable public place!"
003,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking is a popular activity among human beings, especially men. But as we all know, cigarettes contain some poison, many countries have banned smoking at public places. It's not enough, stopping smoking should not only at public places but also at restaurants in the country. Scientists have improved that cigarette has nicotine. It's a kind of poison. People who smoking for a long time may get nicotinism, if it's very serious, people will die for this. And people who always smoking also will have lung cancer. It can't be cured. The patients will suffer unimaginable pain. So, for human being's health, smoking should be banned completely at all restaurants. Smoking is not only bad for smoking people, but also unhealthy for the people around them. When one person is smoking, the people around him may get second-hand smokes. The second-hand smokes also contain nicotine, also harmful for human's body. And we see that, if people smoking in a restaurant, everyone in this restaurant will be harmed by them. As far as I know, smoking also pollute environment. The smokes it produces will pollute our atmosphere. So if we can ban smoking, we will save our world. I don't know why people invented smoking, but I know why people stop smoking. In a word, smoking is bad for our health and also harmful for our word. Banning smoking completely at all restaurants in the country is a little step, one day we will stop smoking all over the world!"
090,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿We always face these scenes that a girl persuading her boyfriend out of smoking in our daily life. It becomes a common sense that we shouldn't't allow the people we care to smoke. So I hold the idea that smoking should be completely banned at the restaurant in the country. As we all know, smoking is harmful to our health, and we know that a number of persons died at an energetic age because of smoking. Many people want to get rid of the addiction to smoke while they just couldn't control themselves. Then, our government must help. The policy that keeps smoking out of our restaurants will be absolutely welcomed. Also, restaurants are public places where we must take others' rights into consideration. There's no reason forcing others who don't want to smoke especially children to get second-hand smoke. Finally, maybe not many people know the fact that smoking also decreases our desire to eat. That's why smokers always look sick and lack of nutrition. Anyway, we come to restaurant to have a feast and we can't tolerate those delicious food wasted. I think the landlord will be no happier because you consume more and keep a better environment in the restaurant."

As a matter of fact, smoking does harm to people's health, it benefits more harm than good. In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. For individual smokers, maybe smoking is a hobby that is a part of their life. But we should observe the problem that the harm of the second-hand smoke. Research says that the second-hand smoke is more serious. Restaurant is especially a public place, if you smoke there, you will do harm to not only yourself, but also the others. It is a morality that not smoking in the public places, and it protect the rights of non-smokers. What's more, it eliminates the harm of smoking more or less. However, it calls on both government and individual smokers to achieve the goal. Government should take some measures, for example, to punish a policy to punish people who smoke in the public places. For smokers, they should be conscious of it. Only in this way, can we have a comfortable environment."
102,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Most people say that being a college student should have a chance to try a part-time job. But I think we shouldn't put much time on this kind of thing. As a student, despite of a college student, we still concentrate on our study. Being a college student means we have to have a lot of courses to study and have plenty of books to read. We also have to finish many tasks which teachers tell us to do. So we may be have little time and energy to think about the part-time job. We should do take some social activities at the right time, which definitely doesn't say we must take those things. As we know, should and must really have different means. If we don't distinguish the position between study and social works, we may be confused about our intention of going to the college. Besides, social activities don't completely equal with part-time jobs. We should make them clear. Social works are ok, but part-time jobs are a waste of time. I know a friend of mine, who ever tried a part-time job. He said that although it sounded perfect, it was very hard to make the two into the balance. During his work, he sometimes worked longer than he imaged. Most of his tasks were tough and boring, but he had to do that. He lost a lot of time to study his work, and didn't finish his homework perfectly. As a result, his final exam was not finished as good as it used to be. He said he learned a lot through this thing. We should keep this: To study well is our duty when we are students whatever the situation is."
365,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, students in college have a lot of spare time in school. Some of them choose to take a part time job to spend their time. Also, there's another voice that against students taking part time jobs. Today, we'll talk about this. First, I'd like to say that I'm very interested in college students taking part time jobs. I'm a grade-one college student. Except going to classes, I have a lot of time in my dorm. When winter comes, I have to stay at my dorm, playing games with my roommates or surfing the Internet. Whenever I play the games, I always recall of my dad and mum's words telling my to work hard in college when I leave home, but my roommates are so passionate that I can't stop playing with them. How to solve the problem without hurting our relationship? I think to go out and take a part time job is a good idea, at least you're not wasting your valuable adolescence time. Taking part time job is to be great beneficial. One can gain experience while make money when taking part time job. The experience in working is very competitive when you graduate and find a real job. You're an grown-up if you're in the college, I think your parents will be glad if they know that you're making money in college, and taking part time job is an excellent chance! People often comment that the after-1990s generation a failure and disgusting in China. I think they are mainly referring to the naughty college students. Our college students really should do something to prove that we are better than they foresaw. If everybody tries to take a part time job, the society may change."
103,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, many college students in foreign countries choose to take a part time job. However, most Chinese college students are still prone to pay little attention to doing part jobs and focus only on their major study. In my opinion, the pros of doing part time jobs overweigh its cons. I have mainly four reasons for it. In the first place, doing part jobs is a symbol of being independent which means you are no more a child and you can take good care of yourself. Second, you can learn quite a lot from the job. It will help you broaden your horizons, gain more experiences and get more close to the society. As a saying goes that experience is the best teacher, the meaningful experiences will make you adjust to the society much better and will benefit you the whole life. Third, as we all know time is limited and valuable in college and doing a part time job is often in conflict with studying. Hence, taking a part job will force you to know how to balance your work and study and how to use time to the fullest. Last but not least, if you take a part time job, you will get a sum of money which can be used to cover tuition and purchase whatever you want. What's more it will also teach your how to handle and manage your money. In conclusion, although learning is our main task and doing part job will take much time, it benefits us quite a lot. From my point of view, universities and college students should make join efforts to advocate college students to take a part time job."
031,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays smoking is banned in public places in more and more countries. And there is a heated discussion about whether smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in China. Personally, I think it inadvisable to smoke in a restaurant. It is universally recognized that the cigarette contains a considerable number of harmful elements. Smoking may not only do harm to the smokers themselves but also to the people around them. So if a person is smoking while others are eating, the eaters will be greatly annoyed. No non-smokers want to be bothered by cigarette smoke. And it will be a piece of good news for them if all the restaurants go smoking free. But I am of the opinion that there should be smoking sections in some restaurants. It is hard for heavy smokers to quit smoking in a short time. If all the restaurants forbid smoking, they may get really uncomfortable. In general, smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants. Restaurants can set non-smoking areas and smoking areas for different customers. But I think that if smoking is permitted, it should always be in an area that non-smokers do not have to go through because no non-smokers want to expose themselves to second hand smoke."
098,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, college life is colorful. Besides studying, students participate in various kinds of activities and some of them have part time jobs. People have different perspective about if it is important for college students to have part time jobs. As far as I am concerned, part time job is just an additional part of college life, not a part of great importance. Part time job can make profit to students. For one thing, student can gain some social experience by means of contacting people outside the campus. For another, the payment can help students from rural family to pay the tuition fee. So it's definitely a beneficial part of college life. However, part time job maybe influence the studying especially when students overdo it. Some of my friends have a really tight schedule just because they have a part time job. Instead of relaxing themselves and do homework, they go to work when we go back to the dormitory. Their reason is that part time job is an important part of college life. I hold opposite opinion that students don't benefit much from part time jobs. There are a couple of reasons to name. Formerly, it will take the time otherwise you will use to study. Curriculum studying is always superior to other part of college life, for we students come to college with the major purpose of acquiring knowledge. Latterly, part time job is not the only way to gain social experience. Some activities can provide you with better opportunities. Generally speaking, when get a payment job; students usually get simple works which can make very limited profit for their future career. Lastly, it's important for people to relax after daily stressful studying, who can help students concentrate on school work better with profit to one's health."

And I find most people can obey the principle. Thus making the air is more fresh and showing the Chinese virtue. After the Expo, I think we should stick to the principle that abandoning the smoking in the public. Good principle should remain and this can improve the whole figure of Shanghai. And we can see more and more non-smoking sighs in the public in order to remind people to cling to it. The results of many researches have shown that the second-hand smoking even has worse effect on others especially children and the old. So when we want to smoke in the public, please think of them. They are innocent. If they are your family members, do you want them have second-hand smoking? Of course, absolutely banning the smoking in China or in Shanghai is impossible. People can smoke freely in private place or in the smoking area in the public. Nowadays more and more non-smoking rooms have been set up in the public places. It shows a good tendency that we have realized this kind of problem and have tried some methods to solve the problem step by step. And then I truly believe that we will lead a healthier and happier life."
190,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There is no doubt that more and more university students look for part-time jobs. However, people argue whether it's beneficial to our college students. In my view, there are more advantages for college students than disadvantages. My reasons are as follows. First of all, it's an opportunity to strengthen our ability. As we all know, now competition becomes heavier and heavier in our society. We should be equipped with knowledge and training skills. And part-time job can give us more practical knowledge. In addition, if we only study unless we study, we may be shifted out by our society. Nevertheless, you can experience what you can't learn during your academic pursuit when you take part in part-time jobs. What's more, the skills you acquire through taking part-time jobs will benefit you even more your future career though now you think it's useless. In university, we have much spare time and feel very bored. Sometimes, we may lose ourselves. So we can make full use of time to take a part-time job. I believe you feel useful and happy. Last, we can earn money from part-time. We can help our family by this. So I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Try to have one if you have time."
138,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I am in favor of the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because some reasons listed below. First, no-smoking can show respect for others. Restaurants are public places in which there must be many people who are non-smoking or even hate the smoke of cigarettes. If you don't want to be blamed by others or spoil your image, you'd better get rid of your addictions to cigarettes. Second, the restaurant is a place to enjoy delicacies rather than cigarettes, so it is just not the right place for someone to light his cigarettes. Though I am non-smoking, I don't think it will be more delicious to eat with a cigarette or two. Third, as is known to all, smoking will do harm to our health. In that case, a total ban on smoking in a restaurant is a way to limit the number of cigarettes for heavy smokers, though the number can be limited is very small. In conclusion, restaurants are places where fresh air is needed and the smell of cigarettes will spoil the appetite of most guests. So, it is a reasonable measure to forbid smoking there. So let the government do something from now on to ban it."

When a student steps into the college, she or he may be immediately confronted with various choices, including whether they should have a part-time job or not. Obviously, increasing number of part-time job is springing up on campus, which confused lots of students. Some people think that it is profitable for college students to take a part-time job. The reasons are as follows. First of all, it's indispensable for college students to accumulate work experience, which is beneficial to their future development. Moreover, students can make money in order to reduce their parents' burdens. Also, they may make full use of their free time rather than waste of time. However, other people hold the view that there is little advantage for college students to take a part-time job. They insist that it is students' obligation to study. And their most important task is to finish their school work and gain graduation certificate successfully. Part-time job takes up most of their times. Furthermore, students have no enough energy to work. It's harm to their health if they have a part-time job. From my point of view, students themselves should have their own plans. They need to develop their ability of protecting themselves when pursuing a part-time job. At the same time, they need to arrange their time properly. It's no surprising that they should experience the social life in advance."

They suffer a lot from their work and life. They smoke to remove their pressure and to them, smoking is not a harmful-only thing. But there is still many other health ways to remove our pressure such as sports and it not necessary to relax yourself via such a harmful way. According to studies leading by Wuhan University, nicotine and some other chemical materials, which come from cigars, does a lot of harm to our bodies, especially lungs. Continuous intake of chemical materials from cigar may eventually causes the increasing ability of getting lung cancer. To improve the average health of humanity, it is emergency to help smokers out of it. In addition, smoking not only does harm to smokers, but also hurts people around, even more seriously. In fact, based on researches around the world, it has been point out that second-hand smoking indeed does more harm to our body. Some of the chemical materials are changed in the air. Some reactions will happened when they meet oxygen and become some other things and these changed materials will cause more healthy problems. In restaurant places, where there would be a relatively bigger crowd in, second-hand smoking is a much more serious problem than smoking. So it is necessary to forbid smoking in restaurant. So, in my opinion, it is best to quit smoking, especially in public places like restaurant. It hurts both you and people around."

There is no doubt that smoking does harm to our health and we all know that smoking can lead to many diseases such as lung cancer. But why so many people still smoke like chimneys? The reason varies from person to person. Some people may think it cool with a cigarette between their lips. Some may smoke just out of curiosity. And some may smoke to refresh themselves. However, smoking is not only harmful to the smokers themselves but also a great threat to others. When we smoke in the restaurant, we unconsciously do harm to others at the same time. We should think for others so we shouldn't smoke in restaurant. On the other hand, when we eat in restaurant, we will feel awful if others are smoking. So we can't have a good mood to enjoy our meals. Imagine we are in a restaurant full of smokes, which must be very bad! And smoking at restaurant is often regarded as a bad manner.

Different people have different views about this question. In my opinion we should ban smoking in the restaurant because it is where people eat food and have a rest there. If someone smoke there it can affect other people, people' emotion can be bad then so they may not come to the restaurant to have meals any more. And we all know smoking is very bad for our health. It can cause smokers to have some disease. Non-smokers sit around them when they smoke can also have some diseases. So smoking should be banned in the restaurant to keep everyone safe and healthy. Smoking in public is also a bad thing, it can affect your personal image. Children in the restaurant may learn from your example. But sometimes there are many people in the restaurant so people have to wait for a long time to have meals so they feel very boring to smoke, it needs restaurants to take actions to improve the efficient.

When it comes to the question whether students should find part time to do, the opinions vary from person to person.

The working experience may help students to find jobs easier after they graduate. There is no denying that finding good jobs is becoming more and more difficult for the graduates. If students can have some working experience, the possibility of they being employed will be higher. Besides, doing part time jobs can help students know how to communicate with people correctly. When a student is doing a part time job, he has to talk with many different kinds of people, even someone who is hard to deal with. They will learn how to deal with people with different character. That's good for their future life. Last but not least, doing part time jobs can earn some money, which may release some part of parents' pressure. Though the money may not be too much, we still can do something with it. For example, we can buy some small gifts for our parents. But one thing we cannot forget is that our study shouldn't be bothered by doing part time jobs. Learning knowledge is the most important thing for the students.

Part-time job give them experience. Join a big company, you need several skill, one of the most valuable skill is experience. Part-time job can give you experience, just like a preparation before class. For example, if you have a part-time job in market, learning make account book and checking sales is your required course.

On this phenomenon, I just have my own opinion. Though to have after-school work has brought a lot of problems. For example, part-time jobs often distract students' attention from their studies, so some students have shown a decline in their studies, and some even play truant. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and learn what is needed for the development of our society. But On the other hand, it helps to build independence in young people and make them more mature, and students who have part-time jobs can relieve the economic burdens of their parents. Most college students have been spoiled by their parents, and even their grandparents. So some of them can do nothing and can't sustain the pressures and stress. To have a part time job can help those students to adapt to society more easily, learning how to communicate with others and how to protect themselves. Some students who have part-time jobs may relieve their parents' economic burdens. The most important is that, to have a part time job can gain skill points. A graduate who only have high scores but no experience is not a real talent so that I just agree the topic about whether it's important for college students to have a part time job."
269,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Not allowing smoking in any restaurants is a very good choice. I believe this for several reasons. Not only will banning smoking improve people's health, it will also build a good dining atmosphere. As is known to all, smoking is not healthy. Unfortunately, when smokers smoke in restaurants, they make other people sick at the same time. When the people who smoke have dinner in the same restaurants, people who are not willing to smoke are passive smoking. In that case, the non-smokers have no choice unless they want to give their dinner. They can only get sicker, which is unfair. Of course, banning smoking in restaurants will please non-smokers. It will also improve the smokers' health. They will have fewer opportunities to smoke, so they will smoke fewer cigarettes. Banning smoking in restaurants can also build a good dining atmosphere. Smokers won't trouble the others if they have no right to smoke in restaurants. There will also be fewer awkward. When smokers cut down the number of cigarettes, the good dining atmosphere will be built easily. Finally, it is a good idea to ban smoking in any restaurants because a ban can reduce conflicts. Non-smokers tend to get annoyed and jealous because smokers have an excuse to take frequent breaks. The most significant conflict, however, is over whether smokers have a right to smoke in restaurants. As we have already seen, non-smokers feel they are not always given a choice. If smoking in restaurants is allowed, they will be forced to breathe harmful air. This may violate their rights, and non-smokers are angry with smokers because of it. It seems clear that banning smoking in restaurants is a good idea. It will reduce conflict and build a good dining atmosphere. It will also benefit health of smokers and non-smokers alike. I believe that just about anything that improves our health is a good idea!"
268,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Many smokers have a misunderstanding that they are not harming other people's health while they are smoking. Many researches tell us that this kind of thoughts is absolutely wrong. Smokers are harming their own health as well as other person's that around him. If a person is smoking in a restaurant, he is destroying other customer's health. Once I come across with a piece of news, it said that a person that is addicted to smoking has a higher rate of getting cancer than normal people, while people that around the smoker has twice to three times higher rate of getting cancer than the smoker, unbelievable! If there are a lot of smokers in a restaurant, how many non-smokers will get harmed due to these smokers? It must be a large figure. Some smokers might be rich, but if you lose your health, any wealth will be useless. Maybe someone smokes because he is under great pressure, or he is desperate with his life, but those can't be a good reason to destroy other person's health. As we can see, a restaurant is a place which usually has a lot of people in it, so smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country for the sake of people's health."
195,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Nowadays, some business say that nobody can smoke in offices and some governments try to ban smoking in all public places. In light with this phenomenon, there is a hot issue on whether smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country or not arise. No doubt, I choose without hesitation, because there are too many benefits about banning smoking that outnumber its disadvantages. As we know, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Imagine that if you smoke in the restaurant and others are eating, you not only pollute the restaurant atmosphere but also disturb others because you give much poisonous gas off into the air. Some smoking say that it takes away some of their freedom. If you can't help smoking, you may smoke in private, not in restaurant or public places. If all factors are considered, it is no difficult to conclude that the advantages of banning smoking in restaurants carry more weight than those of disadvantages. From what has been discussed above, we may finally draw the conclusion that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. So let us take action from now on."
194,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There is no doubt that smoking is a bad habit. Many people in recent years have discussed the possibility of banning smoking completely in the restaurant. There is no argument anymore as to whether cigarettes are unhealthy or not. They can cause cancer, we all know, but we just can't stop smoking. So, from my point of view, the government should take some steps to ban it. Many countries now have laws banning smoking restaurants, because it is the place that people are eating and I am pretty sure that those people don't want to eat around the cigarette. For me, when I smelled the cigarette I want to throw up. I can't stand it. What's more, this is the public place. It is completely unreasonable to smoke. Some countries have taken actions to solve the problem. I think our country also needs to have laws to ban smoking in the restaurant. Also, I hold the view that the smokers should care about his or her own figure because smoking in the public place is immoral. Those persons don't care about others feelings. They are selfish!In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country is perfectly right, for you for us, for all the people think it will benefit to us. So I support it!"
361,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Believe it or not, smoking has become more and more common in our lives. Nobody can deny that we can see it anytime or anywhere. Smokers believe strongly that when they feel tired or upset, a cigarette can certainly help them forget them and gain happiness and energy. Of course, we cannot easily condemn that they are wrong, just because it is unhealthy. But I want to declare that maybe we should consider others' feelings when we enjoy ourselves, especially when we in public. So, in my opinion, smoking should be forbidden in public. In order to keep healthy, not only for others but also for smokers, we really need a law to tell people that smoking in public is impolite. We should try our best to let smokers know that this kind of practice is harmful to everybody. Anyhow, smoking in public is such a bad thing that can only indicate the smoker is a indelicacy person. Of course, we all know quit smoking is such a difficult thing for everybody and forcing smokers not to smoke is also unreasonable. How can we solve this problem? Maybe we can establish some places where smokers can enjoy themselves without any worry! Smoking is bad for our health, and smoking in public is a bad symbol of our soul. At last, I want to say respecting others is respecting ourselves !"
107,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Many people are smoking in the restaurants. We all know the harm of smoking. So, I strongly support the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. I have this opinion because of the following reasons. Smoking is not polite in public place. If you want to smoke, it is your choice. But people around you can smell the smoke. Consequently, smoking in the restaurants will do harm to other people. I can think no better illustration of the idea than the example of my roommate. For instance, my roommate Sun who is used to smoking fought with other people in the restaurant because other people thought the smell is disgusting. I have another argument for my point. Have you thought about the question: how could you eat the food when you smoke? In other words, you can hardly enjoy your food. Actually, the situation is not rare, it is just one of many examples I have encountered. For example, my roommate is Liang. He often smokes when he have meal. Therefore, he is noticeably thin and apparently not healthy. Because of the above reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."
106,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿When you are enjoying a meal in a restaurant, the man who sits near you is smoking, would you feel have no interest in enjoying the delicious food and think the man is very tiresome. I don't know your answer, but I know when this happen to me, I would. I think it is a very bad behavior to smoking in public places, especially in restaurant, First, when one is smoking, other people besides him is also harmed by the secondhand smoke. As we know, secondhand smoke is worse for our health. Especially for women and children, they are affected more deeply. Many diseases are caused by smoke and secondhand smoke, this fact can't be ignored. Second, smokings in a restaurant makes many guests can't enjoy their meals, many people who don't smoke dislike smoking smell. Like me, when I smell smoke, I fell uncomfortable. When I come into a place filled with smoke, I can even not breathe. When we go to a restaurant, what we want is having a good meal and enjoying it rather than smelling secondhand smoke and we should have the right. So, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People who smoke should think about others more often and avoid smoking in public places."
360,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is commonly acknowledged that smoking is harmful to people's health because many harmful substances can come into smokers' lung and make it ill. To make us live better, I think smoking in public places should be forbidden. Forbidding smoking can make the air in public places cleaner. Smoking can spoil air because of the emitted CO2, CO and other poisonous gas. People need clean air to live healthily. If we don't get clean air, we will be ill soon. Besides, if we forbid smoking in public places, a great number of people won't be second-hand smokers. Forbidding smoking is also good for smokers. Smoking is the main reason for lung cancer. A lot of people have died of lung cancer which was caused by smoking. Smokers are always worried about their health. The WTO pointed out that the best way to avoid lung cancer is quitting smoking. People should stop smoking unless they don't mind dying of cancer. Forbidding smoking is good for our country's economic for the government won't have to put large amounts of money on medical insurance. In spite of losing taxes on tobacco, the government will save more on medical insurance. In a word, forbidding smoking in public places is both good for smokers and non-smokers. It is necessary to forbid smoking."
034,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Having entered college, we are all faced with a fact that there is much more spare time than before, which gives us a chance to get part-time job. Adults as we are, it's highly recommended that we take a part-time job. A part-time job gives us a preview about the outside society before we totally step in. More and more graduates complaining about the uselessness of the college course, we can see the importance of combining what we are learning and what we are going to do in certain company. What's more, a preview about the society may help us handle the relationships with others as well. Experiences from part-time job enrich our college life. Instead of playing online games all day long. Getting out is a much better way to make our college life full and interesting. When working, you will meet people with various personalities, some of which may become your lifelong friends. Last but not least, we can make money. Not only can it release the financial pressure of your family, but also you will feel the great joy of achievements in independence. To sum up, part-time job are both essential for our career plan and helpful to our college life. Why not get one."
252,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿First of all, let's check out why students do part time jobs. There are three main reasons that could firmly account for this phenomena. First, more and more students want to be economically independent and PTJ is a perfect way. Second, students can learn a lot which they shall never learn in class from PTJ. Third, the whole society is gradually admitting college students as its capable modernist, which provides more opportunities to college students. Of course, each coin has two sides. Some people argue that PTJ may cost a student a lot. A lot of students can't fully concentrate on their studies since they take PTJ and then their grades fall sharply---which is not good in the long term. In my opinion, there is a balance between study and work. Students in college may get a lot of free time and PTJ is ok for a college student as long as he or she gets a good hang of using free time. Everyone shall get their own job, why not get used to it when you are young?"
253,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, part time job play a big role in college students life. I firmly think that it is essential to do part time job for us college students. To begin with, it can enlarge our horizon that we do a part time. When we communicate with social people in the work, not only can we learn a lot of technique skills, but we can also get to know more information from the society, which we can not learn in our school. On the other hand, we almost learn all of our knowledge in the class but have not put it into exercise. It is part time job that can teach us to us use the knowledge more effectively in our life. Last but not least, doing a job can make us aware of how to earn money and how hard it is to earn even one cent. Doing a job will cultivate our economical life style, which will leave a deep impression to us who have been taken care of since we were babies. To sum up, even if part time job may be hard to us, it is a perfect way to make us mature and close to the society."
035,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with those who think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The first reason is that it is a preparation for our future jobs. If we have tried part-time jobs, we may be confronted with hardships, and then learn to deal with tough situations by ourselves. When we step into society, the way will be smoother because we are already experienced. The second explanation for my opinion is that owing a part-time job during college time can make us recognize the value of money. Our parents work very hard to ensure us a comfortable learning environment. They try every means to save money. By working, we can relieve their burden as well as enjoying the joy it brings to have the opportunity to earn money for ourselves. After all, we can make many new friends outside our campus. They have identities, various interests, and sometimes outstanding talents. By being with them, we can learn many things that cannot be acquired on campus. If we develop a constant friendship with them they may be of great importance when it comes to us to be the leader. There are many other reasons for us college students to have a part-time job. All in all, you have made an informed choice if you are determined to take a part-time job."
313,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Nowadays many college students want to have a part time job. The tendency is becoming more and more popular. Some people approve of this because they think it is a good chance to improve their ability. But other students don't agree on it. They find that if they spend their time on doing a job, they can't focus on their study. It's just a waste of time. In my opinion, although there are both advantages and disadvantages in finding a part-time job for college students, I still believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, it can truly improve our ability. As we all know, the knowledge we have already learned from schools is very limited. And the society is also a school. So learning from the society can also improve us. Second, we can get some reward from the job. Although the amount can be very little, we can learn that No pains, no gains. The little reward can also help us to understand the hardness of doing a job and form a good habit of saving money. Third, we can also feel the importance of study. In addition, as to the problem of wasting time, I believe that it depends on different people. But if we arrange time properly, doing a part-time job will not have a great influence on our study. In one word, it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
175,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In my mind, a part-time job is very useful for our college student although it may have some disadvantages. A part-time job can bring us not only the experience in our life but also the experience in being a true social human being. First of all, the environment in a campus is peace and simple, in these surroundings we could not know the real life in the recent society. If we have a part-time job, we should touch the society early than others, so we should have more competitive than the other. It is good for us to get a good job in the future. Secondly, we have the opportunity to meet more people and communicated with them. Communication is an important factor to be had in today's extremely competed society. The last but not the least, we can use our spare time to show our ability, we can make some pocket money, we can take care of ourselves which could make our parent feel relieve that we have already grown up. Many student may disagree with me, but I'll say that they do not know the feeling how great to have a part-time job especially you get your first salary. I could clearly remember that I have keep my first salary for a long time, I did not want to waste it. If someone want to get a part-time job, I will give him some encourage. Come on to get it."
174,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays more and more college students are crazy about taking part-time jobs. I believe that a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages, and it is important for the students to have an appropriate balance between study and work. Some people believe that taking a part-time job certainly brings about several advantages. First, students who do a part-time job can earn themselves sums of money which helps to release the financial burden on their family. Second, it gives the students a chance to know the society to learn to be independent. In addition, they can also get financial reward and working experience as well, such as teaching or selling practice, which is helpful to their growth. What's more, they can put what they have learned into practice so that they can improve their studies and personalities, which are beneficial in their later lives. However, problems may also arise. Firstly, some students spend too much time doing part-time jobs while pay little attention on their studies. Secondly, when taking part-time jobs, the students may be distracted from their studies by the colorful lives in the society. Thirdly, some students may be cheated or hurt by their employers when they enter into the society, because they don't know how to protect themselves. In my opinion, taking part-time jobs provides students with more chances of social practice, which benefits them both psychologically and economically so long as they keep a balance between study and jobs."
288,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Well, I don't think having a part time job is necessary for a college student. But it should be extremely helpful for college students. Different people may have lives, so for some student he or she will be suit for a part time job or not. Namely, part time job is not necessary for everyone, though it may be welcome to some students. What influences a student's decision on doing a part time job is consist of family background financial situation education environment and personal college plans. For someone who was born in a rich family, doesn't lack money and is showered by academic voices, what he needs to do is get higher degrees, higher scores and more knowledge. If he chooses to do a part time job, it may get in the way of his study. On the contrary, for a person from a poor family or who plans to struggle in the society, learning how to survive is more necessary. Ability skills and relationship are more important for this type of person. In that case, having a part time job may be a better choice. All in all, as we see, something may have two sides."
047,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,﻿The trend of smoking is increases fastly. Different institutes have published the reports about health. In every country everyone have great prejudice against smoking. Smoking produces an excitement in our nervous system. Particularly a mentally and physically depressed man have desire to smoke. But smoking is effective our mind adversely. The people who are smoking and use drugs are always suffer from cough and cold. Due to smoking our eyesight and digestion are damaged. It weakness our will power and many people becomes heart patient. Against the smoking media have perform its responsibilities. In our society smoking is very common. Everywhere we see the people who have smoking mostly of them are chain smokers. Smoking is very common in every street. In restaurant we almost see the smokers. Due to smoking in restaurant vulgarity must be produced. In family restaurant the families are irritated due to smoking. Everyone dislike the smoking. Smoking is bad for every human. It damages the lungs. It is harmful for other with the smoker. Cigarette should must be banned in shops and in restaurant it should be banned.
381,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I agree the opinion that college students should have a part-time job. I have three main reasons to support my ideas. Firstly, we have much spare time in our college life, and how to make use of this part of time make a great difference. If we only do the scientific or literal work in our spare time, we will become indifferent to the work and lack of practical experience which will make us stay at a low situation in the social competition. In addition, lack of work experience will always keep us from the society like a mist. It's competent to do a job in the enterprise if we had similar experience. Secondly, during the period of part-time job, we can get acknowledge of the companion in the company. And these people can do a great help to our way to be qualified, and the relationship will be a key to our application for the job. Last but not the least, experience of part-time jobs can also make us have some pocket money. Though the amount is not important to us, the feeling of managing the money we earned by ourselves is helpful to our experience of management. Above all, It's of great importance and essential for us to have a part-time job in college life."
286,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Smoking in public places can lead to more people begin to smoke especially young people which is bad for our society. If a kid see an adult smoking, he may think it is very cool. In his eyes, those heroes who smoke in the movies are very charming and fascinating. However, in the real world, he find out that someone can also smoke and show that he is very cool. In this way, many young people want to learn to smoke. There are also some young people who are just curious about it. Once they begin to smoke, it is hard for them to quit. Young people are the future of our country. If their health are damaged, how can our country become strong in the future? If the smokers are not careful in public places, they may put something on fire which is very dangerous. In history, many forest fire accidents were just caused by a small cigarette. Though it was small, it burned a large quantity of trees and did harm to the environment of the world. If you smoke in a place which is crowded with people, you might burn other's clothes of even their skin, though you are not on purpose. In that situation, everyone hate you. The most important is that smoking in public places is bad for the health of the people around you. According to the science survey, if a person smoke, there will be a lot of poisonous materials in the air around him. The materials are so poisonous that people around him will get more harm than the smoker himself. The fact is that these people are all innocent and it is very unfair. In a conclusion, to protect all people' health, smoking in public places should be forbidden."
048,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I'm agree with the upper statement. First of all, college students are already adults; they can be independent, and able to do things by themselves in their own way. And they have their own thoughts and ideas, so they don't need to depend on other people. Secondly, having a part time job can help college students to get many experiences. They can meet many different people when they are working. They also learn knowledge not from books. They will become more confident and mature if they do part-time job. Thirdly, part time job can help college students to widen their views step by step. In the part time job, students cannot only learn a lot of things which can't in class, but also see a more colorful world. So they get real information about the society from doing part-time job. Fourthly, because most part time job paid, this salary can be used as the tuition cost of living. In other words, having a part time job also can reduce the financial burden of parents. On the other hand, it also can improve college students' self-awareness. Finally, college students have plenty of spare time, they should do something meaningful. In the end, I have to say, college students must arrange their own time reasonably if they decide to do part time job. Don't affect their normal study. That's all."
326,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ As college students, we have a lot of spare time after classes. So some students tend to do some part-time jobs which both have advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, it is not necessary for every student to do part-time jobs in his spare time. Just as what I have said, a proper part-time job can benefit a college student a lot. First, it is a good opportunity for college students to learn more about the society. So after their graduation, when they come into the society for the first time, they won't feel nervous or upset. Second, we can learn a lot of specific skills which is useful for us to find a good job after graduation. What's more, doing a part-time job means that we can earn money by ourselves. We are adults. We can make a living by our own hands. Obviously, to a man who is ambitious and can control himself well, a part-time job benefits a lot. However, a part-job can also have bad effects on our studies. Take a friend of mine as an example. After a few weeks' study in the college, he thought the college life is easy and free which meant he could do something more challenging. Then, he found a part-time job. It really occupied a large part of his time. At first, he was so interested in it. Little by little, he felt tired and wanted to give it up. He became impatient and spent less time on his study. At the final-term examination, he failed to pass the math test which means he would have to study it again in grade two. So in my opinion, we should be more careful when we decide to get a part-time job. If we can arrange our time well, a part-time job is no doubt a way to improve ourselves. If not, we should think it over when we do the final decision."
214,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is fairly well that smoking in the restaurant is a bad behave which harms both the health of the smoker and others in the restaurant. But from my point of view, forbid it completely is impossible. Suppose smoking is completely banned at all in the restaurant people may smoke outside it and then get into. Then the provisions will with no meaning. It is well known that even though the tax of cigarettes is very high, the number of people who smoke is still very high. Therefore, forbidding smoking in all the restaurant is not a fundamental method to make people away from cigarettes. Moreover, the restaurants in china are of different levels. And people in china also have different level of education. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, there will be a lot of people who can't understand it and it will also have a bad influence on those small restaurants. Considering the possible consequence above, I think it is reasonable to forbid smoking in high-grade restaurants, but forbidding smoking in all the restaurants at all is unrealistic and not feasible."
215,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Now more and more people smoking in public, I think it doesn't only influence the smokers, but also have a strong impact on the other people's healthy. So, I think smoking must be completely banned in China especially at all the restaurants. Now let us have a conjecture, you are having dinner with your friends at a good restaurant. You are happily eating and chatting with each other. Then suddenly, you smell the unpleasant smell of cigarette, and then, when you eat your food, you will feel bad and can't swallow it only because the smoke is so strong. I think you must not be happy any more. So, I must tell the people who smoke at restaurants can you stop smoking at public for the purpose of themselves and others. Think of this matter from the angle of the doctors, smoke have a very bad influence on people's trachea, when human are eating, their tracheas are expanding, if breathe much smoke at this time, people are very easy to have tracheitis, bronchitis and other diseases like these. In a word, smoking is bad for people's healthy, smoking at restaurants is worse. Now, in China, this matter is very serious, so, we must help ourselves, when we see others smoking at restaurants, we should put a stop to them."
073,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿When I am in restaurant, I can usually smell that someone is smoking but I can't say anything at all, and many people have the same feeling as me, so many people think the government should publish a law to ban smoking in restaurant, I have a mixed idea about it. It is obvious that people smoking will influence the people around him. But we can ban completely smoking in restaurant as a people not smoking; we should consider the feeling of people smoking. First, we can build a special room in restaurant for people to smoke, the idea will meet people's need of smoking and the smoke will not influence people's dinner. Before the special room being built, people can smoke in toilet or beside the junk barrel. After the law being published, if any people smoke in the restaurant and influence the other people's eating, in restaurant, the waiter should advise them to go to the special room for smoking politely and if the smokers are rude and continue to smoke influencing other people, waiter can reveal the law to them for money. Generally speaking, the smoker can smoke in the restaurant, but they should smoke in the toilet or special room and guarantee they will not influence other people."
133,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Someone likes to smoking, but someone does not like. If somebody smoke in the restaurant, he may disturb others or annoy someone. But, I am not in favor of banning smoking in the restaurants completely. Those are my reasons. Firstly, I don't believe that everyone can stop smoking when he stays in some place. To the heavy smokers, stopping them smoking is terrible like death. Secondly, for example, in our country, the cigarette companies are in the control of the government. Its benefits for the government are great, which advances the development of our country's economy. Thirdly, smoking or not is determined by smokers themselves. No one can force them to do something. In my opinion, smoking can be banned at some restaurants in the country, but not all. Whether smoking should be banned depends on the restaurants'needs. I have some suggestions. The restaurants can provide a special room for the smokers. And if the restaurants have the conditions, they can equip with equipment of dealing with the snoking. All of those are my ideas."
132,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In modern life, more and more people are addicted in smoking. In china, smoking has been banned only in some limited public places. So, if you walk on the road or other public place, you will see many people smoking. But in fact, it is not healthy for people, especially the second-hand smoking. The second-hand smoking is the smoke that is breathed out by the smoking man. It is more harmful for people. It will increase the possibilities of having cancer or other disease in lung. In addition to the harmful aspect, smoking in public also expresses a bad image on others. Maybe someone thinks that it is cool to smoke. They look on smoking as a good way to show themselves. However, it is just a misunderstanding. Smoking will not brighten your image. On the contrary, it will bring you many negative influences. Finally, smoking does much harm to the environment. It will pollute the air. When we breathe the unclear air, we may well be ill. Smoking at a restaurant is harmful in particular. In a word, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. As the less smoking we take, the healthier we will be."
354,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Smoking, one of the most efficient health chronic killers in 21st century, is nowadays drawing more and more people's attention. As is known to all, smoking is the source of many kinds of diseases, such as heavily coughing \asthma and lung cancer. It does great harm to human body, especially for newly-born babies. It's recently reported that a bowl of boiled water with butt is enough to put a baby to death. Moreover, it is also harmful to the surroundings when smoking in public. Cigarettes give off poisonous gas into the air, not only affecting the plants nearby, but also harming non-smokers around. Cigarettes have an even greater bad impact on passive smokers. Accordingly, many non-smokers are against smoking. Governments are putting up a ban on smoking in public places. It is a measure to protect our health and the environment. But many smokers argue that this action strips them of freedom. They have the right to do what they like. It is lame, isn't it? Non-smokers have the right to breathe in fresh air which smokers are about to pollute instead. If must, smokers need a private room to separate the smoke from the public. And they still have the freedom. As far as I am concerned, giving up smoking is the best beneficial decision you make. It is good to all of us."
266,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿College is a place for our youth to get knowledge and also to get more social experience. When we graduate we also need learning, I think the college is to educate people learning all your life, and learning even you are very busy. When we get into the society, we must to work, at the same time, we should keep learning. How to do the two things at the limited time, how to schedule your time. It's more important that the knowledge your learn. Do the part time job is very good way to help you scheduling the time. We go to college at the age 18 or 19, it's a special time. 18 means you are an adult. You must be learn to support yourself and know how to earn your live. You can't be a children hoping your parents' supply. Do the part job, the salary may not enough for you, but at least you know, you should do well now, for your future and your family. So I think it's important for college people to have a part time job. It's a useful thing to make our teenagers grow up well."
001,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Now many parents and teachers disagree that college students have their own part-time jobs. Because they are believe that students will spend their study-time on working. But I do not think so, I think a part-time job is one of the most important things in college life. It will be the precious experience in your whole life. Firstly. Part-time job is a good way to fill your spare time after class. Many students spend time on shopping, singing or playing computer games which are pointless. Why do not we take a part-time job to instead of those entertainment ? We can even earn some money from the job by ourselves at least. Secondly. Part-time job can adds your career experience, which is a very useful part in your future life after you graduate. You will learn much knowledge that can not be found in school lessons. Social experience is the biggest chip for graduated students when they interview jobs, it's easier to find jobs for those who have accumulated experiences in part-time jobs. Thirdly. As a matter of fact, a lot of college students from poor families, so taking a part-time job for them is one of the way to afford their college fees. Although the money may be not enough, but that is all they have earned by themselves. From what I have said, it is important to college students to have a part-time job. Study also must be pay attention too, so we should balance the part-time job and study well, after all, the first job of students is study."
093,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with it. It can not only help us improve ourselves by doing a part-time job, but also we can make some money in this process, it is important to some poor students. At the same time, it can help us communicate others better, so we can make more friends. In modern society, many companies take it that whether you have the related work experience as a standard to employ staffs. So if you want to find a good job after graduation, you have to have a appropriate part-time job. Of course, you can take many other ways to achieve these goals, such as holiday social practice, community benefit, and so on. But in comparison, you can't make money and it takes more time by these ways. So if you have no much time and want to earn a little money, it is the best way to exercise yourself that have a part-time job. But on the other side, learning is the duty of students; you can't affect your academic when you have a part-time job. In a word, as a college student, if you want to know the society deeply and improve yourself quickly, you'd better to have a part-time job."
108,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Many people say that college is a small society. College life is not only full of studying. Learning knowledge about major and improving our ability of communicating with others both are very important! In order to adapt ourselves to the fast changes of society and make our experiences more colorful, taking a part-time job in our leisure time is a good choice. It's possible for us to have a part-time job. In college, we have more freedom. Our leisure time is enough. And there are many jobs provided for you. You can make your own plan and work hard for the jobs you want to do. There is no doubt that you will benefit from the experience. Firstly, you can get direct wages. It does not only can reduce the heavy burdens of our parents, but also can taste the happiness on the moment of getting the money which is made by us. The second point, which I think is more important, is a good way to create new experiences. So we will be well prepared for our future life after we graduate from university. In conclusion, for college students taking part-time jobs is practical and important. Just try and be brave to see how far you can go."
109,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Currently, it's a common phenomenon that a great many college students are engaged in seeking for a part- time job. In my point of view, owning a job will undoubtedly make a difference to us students studying at a university. To begin with, the job can be an economic resource so that we can save a great deal of money for our family. On one hand, we can relieve the burden of our parents to some extent. They don't need to devote all the energy to making money and they can set aside some time to do what really appeal to them. On the other hand, the limited but sufficient amount of money will mainly constitute our daily expense. Not only does a part-time job benefit us in college life, but it may also be a valuable wealth when we step into real society. Because this experience where we can clearly recognize the difficulty of earning money will definitely contribute to boosting our independence and ability of communication with strangers. Never let the idea wander in your mind that doing a part-time job is just a waste of time we should have spent on study. If you think like that, you're completely wrong. As a matter of fact, the capability of coping with social problems is equally as important as the certificate on study when you apply for an employment."
144,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As we all know, smoking is not good for our health. Nowadays, a lot of people pass away because of smoking. When someone smokes, the fog will be in the air, so it makes the air not fresh. Unfortunately, if somebody breaths the fog, the poisonous physic will do harm to one's health and it is for you and for other people. When you smoke in a restaurant, you may feel it is a normal thing to yourself but it may be not a pleasure thing to other people in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant will break the harmonious circumstance and influence the feeling of people who are having their food. I think it is not a great thing to break one's good mood when you know your behavior will have this effect. I know it may be difficult for people to stop smoking in the restaurants but this policy is necessary. Although the origin is hard, I think if you persist, it will have a surprising success. Smoking completely bans at all the restaurants in the country that can make a good model to other political measures. Banning smoking may have a good effect on decreasing population who are smoking now and will be addicted to smoking. I think it is a good policy."
322,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Should smoking be forbidden in public places? I strongly hold the opinion that it must be stopped. There do exist uncountable harms of smoking in the public and I'm urged to see the ban against smoking in practice in a larger scope. As we all know, smoking does harms to our body and ruins our health. The smoker himself or herself inevitably suffers from the poisons that exist in the small cigarette. And on the other hand, people around him or her will have to be the second-handed smokers. Exposed in this condition for a long time, the innocent people will tend to be in poor health. Secondly, smoking in the public can also lead to many tragic accidents, such as conflagration. In 2002 of Xi'an, a large nightclub was on fire, heavy smoke constantly sent off from the building. The accident caused dozens of deaths, shocking people around the country. There are still many other tragedies caused by the small cigarette, and we don't want to see them happen again and again. After looking back on them, we can see the urgent to forbid smoking in the public, especially in places which can easily catch fire. But to be frankly, if too much pressure are put on the smokers, they would probably pour scorn on the ban. So, I think some cubs should be set especially for smokers, just like the divided smoking area and no-smoking area. Considering the foreseeable harms and hidden danger of smoking in the public, there is no time for the government to focus on this issue."
145,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I agree with the idea because I think it is really bad to smoke in the public, such as restaurants. We all know that there are still many people smoke in the public, nowadays. It has many bad effects for all the people, not only yourself, but also the others. On the one hand, though people are finding it entertaining to smoke, it does harm in several ways. You will breathe bad air. In the same way, it will have bad effects on the people around you in the public places. From a professional standpoint, smoking in the public places makes everyday bad. On the other hand, it does harm to the atmosphere, and it will affect the environment, too. We all know that there are many people in the public places, so it is hard to make the air clean. After a long time, the air will become worse and worse. Maybe it can cause some diseases. In a word, it has many bad effects. We should control ourselves not to smoke in the public places. In conclusion, we can't smoke in the public places. Because there are many bad effects. Apart from the two bad effects, there are many other bad effects. So let's stop smoking in the public places."
211,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿It is important for college students to have a part-time job I do agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Lack of money may be the most import reason for us college students to search for a part-time job as we knew. For some students it is the part-time job that provides them with the fundamental cost of living. And it will make it possible to start a life without parents' financial aid although we should have been self-reliable in as an adult. It is true that thinking of the hardship we will consider fully before we spend the money made by ourselves. Moreover, as college students, aside from academic knowledge, we should gain more experience through those part-time job. I had a part-time job of teaching a high school student math one year ago. At weekends, I should wake up early to take the first bus while my roommates were enjoying the beautiful dreams. But being paid for 30 RMB per hour, I did obtain a sense of achievements through this part-time job. I think what we gain through part-time jobs is not only the money but also the particular experience after hard working. I think the college life will lack color if we live out four years in college without doing a part-time job."
077,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Nowadays, plenty of college students would like to find a job on their free time. To have a part-time job, for example, being a teacher who helps senior students with their weak lesson, is becoming more and more popular and even be smart. Before I have got into the university, I once thought that I should get some part-time job on my weekends or holidays because it can strong my will and improve my ability, but things got changed now. I remembered when I was in senior 3, the burden of study was too heavy to hold. At that time, not only parents but also teachers told us if we try our best to be accepted by a ideal college, things will all be fine and the university is the heaven for us and we can do most of thing that we like.. But the fact is opposite, we don't have enough time to do a part-time job, because my free time is made up of studying, variety of activity which we are forced to attend and learning to achieve different kinds of certifications because we need it when we find the formal job. To find a part-time job, I think, time is the first element and we can do nothing without it. I suggest that some boring activities could be canceled and our student could be given more time to do something meaningful, but it need attempt and time."
076,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Part-time job is a kind of social practice activity, which pays back material and soul rewarding, for brain and body's work for special organization or person. Of course, on the foundation of reasonable time-arrangement. I have three reasons to support. Firstly, having part-time jobs, students can earn extra money, which can relieve their parents' economic burden to complete their studies better, and have an insight into society, which is good for social practice and their resume. Part-time jobs make you get new friends, make your campus life colorful, part-time jobs teach you how hard it is to earn money, so you will understand your parents and be more thrifty! Secondly, to have part-time jobs is good for college students, social resource help foster students in wider and complexes space, to make contact with society frequently is good for graduate employment, good for students to start an enterprise, good for academic study industrialization. So, it's good for college student's development. Thirdly, to have part-time jobs is good for society. Students can do work professional when employers need short-time worker, and that's little-cost. Students earn extra money through doing a part-time job; government's burden is relieved effectively. Some years later, college schools will supply graduates with more work experience to society, society can shorten the time to make them know society. In conclusion, it is good for students to have part-time jobs."
318,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think that for college students, part time job does play a important role in college life. And this can be concluded from three parts. The first one is experience. University is quite different from high school. I think the two main points are studying freely and being closer to society. In this reason, we need find more ways to approach to the society. Part time job can just take on this task. We can see that when we take part time job, no matter you wash dishes or do as a tutor, you are working like a society member in fact. You work in other workers'way, get paid like other workers. From the beginning to the end, you can receive the experience of worker different from the life you get used in school. If you have the work experience before you graduate, you can overcome the work barrier easily comparing to those who don't. Ability is another award from part time job. There is no doubt that we almost lose the ability to make conversation with others effectively since we just focus on study in high school. As a result, we should exercise this ability as soon as possible. Part time job can also provide this chance for you to improve your skill to talk with others. For instance, you can not avoid talking with your boss, your partner and you consumer. In this case, you can exercise talking ability without difficult. Last but not least, part time job is fun. You can image the huge happiness you will get when you are get paid the first time. No matter what you do, from the library assistant to dormitory protector, you will make a lot of true friends because of working together. I think it is really fun when you make one and one new friend and fight with them. It may be hard, but the happiness is bigger, isn't it?"

There are numerous researches to prove the harm of smoking and everyone knows the dangers of smoking. There are also many researches pointed out the dangers of second-hand smoke, even it's more harmful to our health, few of us really aware of it. I hate smoking, I hate being a place filled with smoke, and it makes me feel sick. I notice that in many public places most smokers don't care about others' feelings. They smoke in public places as at their home, especially in restaurant. You can't imagine how bad mood you will have when you entered a restaurant filled with smoke and how disgusting it smells. That's all my real experience. So, one day, I think, maybe smoking should be completely banned by all the restaurants in the country. First of all, smoking is a personal choices, you totally have right to choose smoking or no-smoking, but it doesn't mean the same applies to public places. Actually if you smoke in a public place, you are forcing others smoking with you, you are forcing them to do something which would be very harmful to their health. From a moral standard, smoking in restaurant is prohibited. Second, most of clients come to restaurant with a good mood, they want to enjoy their meal, then image that how will you feel when you eat an excellent food but in a small room filled with smoke. Based on those two reasons, I think smoking should be completely banned by all the restaurants in the country that should not only be done from moral perspective, but also from the law perspective."
351,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more college students are told to do some part-time jobs if they are free. I think it is very important for college students to do so. To do some part-time jobs benefit college students a lot. College students can gain some social experience from part-time jobs. In China, students are far isolated from the society. Growing up with too much homework to do, too many tests to past, students have little chance to gain social experience during the secondary schools, which is very important when they graduate. Part-time jobs provide the chances. By doing some part-time jobs, college students will know more about current conditions of the job and knowledge that can't learn from the books but the jobs. College students can get some abilities from part-time jobs. A counter in the supermarket will be more careful and a salesman or salesgirl can learn to communicate with various people and be more patient. Each job requires abilities, which will help students become more and more excellent. What's more, students can get some money by doing part-time jobs. It can not only lighten the burden of their parents but also make students more independent. Besides, they will learn the hard to get money so that they will be grateful to their parents and won't waste money. Study hard and do some part-time jobs, then the campus life will be wonderful."
262,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Is Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in our country? I think many people who are against smoking will say yes immediately, as smoking have a bad influence on the health of smokers and people sitting beside them and affect their moods as well. But can it be a adequate reason to ban smoking at all the restaurants in the country. What do the smokers think about? Since they are addicted to smoking, it seems cruel to ban their rights to relax. Despite that as a person always objects smoking in public place, I still do not support the idea above, at least some special places should be set for smoking people, like smoking rooms in railway. In the other aspect, restaurants provide proper places for people communicating with others, therefore, these occasions are quite relaxed. Once smoking being banned at all the restaurants, there surely will be a sharp decrease in the number of customes. All in all, though smoking in public places is impolite, but I still in favor of the idea that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."
167,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Why the sign 'No Smoking' is placed everywhere? Because we all know that smoking is bad for our body and our environment. So smoking should be banned everywhere, no matter at restaurants or other places. There are some reasons below. On the one hand, smoking makes the air polluted. I think no one likes to breathe dirty air when they are at table. Besides, restaurant is a public place, where someone' behavior should not threat others' benefits, and smoking is such that makes damages to people. One the other hand, smoking just means to suicide slowly. Many reports have said that smoking is harmful to our lungs and increases the rate to get lung disease, not only the smoker but also others around them. In fact, the latter are more likely to get ill. So for the sake of our family and earth, everyone should stop smoking no matter where and when. As we all know, there is no benefits to smoke. Since restaurant is a loyal place to have meal, all of us should respect the public place. That is to say, we should try our best to fight with smoking, and smoking should be banned at all restaurants in country."
301,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In my eyes, there is no doubt that smoking should be forbidden in public places. Because I think smoking is to public places what a back spot is to a piece of white paper. As we all know, smoking is harmful to the health of not only smoker but also other people around. Public places are used to work, study and entertainment for people. So it should be a good environment and in a good atmosphere. However the smoke form smokers can break the atmosphere so that others cannot work on or study on. When others smell the smoke, they may also want to smoke or not feel well. In a word, the smoke has a bad effect on others in public places. What's worse, sometimes it is very dangerous to smoke in some public places. For example, it is possible that smoking causes fire at a gas station. Smoking in public places reflects smokers' low quality. It will give others a bad impress ion just because there is one people smoking in a public place. In a word, without question, smoking should be forbidden in public places."
300,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking is not a good habit. It costs a lot of money and will do great harm to smokers' health. But there never lacks heavy smokers. Not only do them smoke at home, but they also smoke a lot in public places, such as coffee cafe, hall, church, etc. I think it is not so appreciate. Public places are for all so smoking there is unbearable for the bad smell. What's more, it will pollute the air and make others to do a second smoking when nobody is aware of it. So, I am strongly against for smoking in public. From my point of view, I think smoking is completely a bad habit because it brings us no benefits. It just like drugs, people are addicted to it and are damaged by it slowly. Watch those who die from lung disease, most of them are heavy smokers. So we should give up smoking for our family and health. Smoking is never important and no one will laugh at you if you can not smoke. Finally, what I want to say is that if someday we want to smoke, please think that what we will do will cause such damage."
166,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Should smoking be banned in all public places? I think it is a very serious problem during the smokers. Some support the policy, some against the policy. It is hard to decide which is right or wrong. In my mind, I support the point to ban the smoking in all public place, like restaurants, bus station, and so on. Not for others, but also for the smokers. Various modern researches show that smoking is very harmful to smoker. Smoking causes various diseases for example, when smoking much oxygen is used and less oxygen come to the brain, lungs and heart. This is very dangerous to young people. People should have a good health to do everything. Without a health body, person cannot do something that you like to do. Smoking also has great influence on family. As you know, smoking cost a lot of money. So smoking is not a lightly economic burden. And more terrible things are that smoking will damage DNA, which will change family from physiology and smoking cannot be stopped easily like drugs. According above statements, smoking should be banned because smoking is harmful to health, bad influence on family. Banned smoke can bring us comfortable living environment. Only a comfortable environment, people can live a happy live. So I support the idea to ban the smoking on public."
232,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Part-time job is a new kind of working method suited for those students who don't have enough time to take a full-time job. A part-time job can provide the students with the study and living expense they need as well as plentiful working experience. But it doesn't mean that everyone has a must to do a part-time job. It depends on one's situation. In my opinion, a student should know what he or she is doing and going to do in the whole life, and value the advantages and disadvantages when making decisions. If a student is having challenge in paying the tuition fee, doing a part-time job is a must. Otherwise he cannot continue his education. Well, if a student is not poor and he doesn't have a lot of pressure in study, he can have much spare time to manage. In this situation, doing a part-time job is still a good choice than playing computer games in dormitory. So part-time job is also good for the students who have a lot of spare time and don't want to be so relaxed, it can help students gain work experience and fasten their steps to the society. But if a student has to study a lot in college, he must treasure his time. It's unwise to do part-time job using the limited time and eventually interrupted the study. So, in conclusion, different cases should be analyzed independently. Part-time job is suitable for many people who face economic problems or have abundant spare time, but not for those who are busying furthering their studies."
054,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have the following reasons. It takes a long time for us to realize the importance of having a part-time job for college students. In fact, having a part-time job has a lot of advantages. First of all, finding a part-time job is a good way to improve students' practical abilities. Take a friend of mine for example, he took a part-time job as a food deliver during the summer vacation time. He told me that he had been more patient after he took that job and he thought that he has improved his skills in society. In addition, finding a part-time job can make your life diverse. You will feel a sense of alive and you will find that life is more interesting. But today's students don't like part-time job. They think it is a kind of waste of time. What's more, some of students say that they can't near the cruelty of society. In fact, disadvantages exist. But all in all, having a part-time job is a kind of practice for college students. It can be training before we enter the real society and it can help us improving our skills."
233,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, most of the parents are opposite to their elder counterparts. They don't let their children study for whole day, instead, they encourage these college students to do some part-time job after class. As for college students, having a part-time job is as equally important as taking classes. For one thing, a person who spare whole period in class and library may be good at theory.. However, as is known to all, we can't work a creature only with theory, so the one with a part-time job experience will show advantages in later work. To some degree, having a part-time job can not only earn some money to fulfill your study, it also private a chance for students to acknowledge how to communicate with strange person in real society, that plays an important role in their life. For the other, a part-time job is supposed to spare a period of college study. In order to balance the studying time and the working time, students can develop an ability of operating time. Besides, work after class may ask for a strong basis, including both physical and mental. To do best of job, one can develop a sense of never giving up, which will benefit college students for good. In short, having a part-time job is important, for it will leave college students not only experience, but also an immortal mind of resolute and straightforward."
209,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Agree. I am quite with this statement. I don't want to talk about whether it is good or not to smoke. the result is so clear. And I can understand why so many people still keep smoking will themselves know SMOKING IS BAD TO HEALTH clearly. It's their habit. But smoking in public should be banned. public place is a place where everyday a mess of people gather at including children women with babies and old people. Smoking is a habit of who is smoking, but these guys have no rights to do harm to the people without the bad habit. So I am agree with the statement. Maybe someone think it's much better to divide the restaurants into two part SMOKING ALLOWED ones and SMOKING BANNED ones. But I don't think so. for the fact that it is clear that smoking is bad to our health. So we should try to get everyone out of the bad habit, and making every restaurants and even every public places no-smoking is also a great way by making smokers fell that they are not accepted by the others with the bad habit, and I believe that between smoking and being accept by public, most people will choose the last one."
208,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in China? Many people think so, I think it is a very realistic problem. As we all know, smoking is bad to our health. What's more, it's influence people around you. Restaurants is a place that you should pay attention to your behavior and manner very well. So from this point, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. But in the other hand, however, don't think so. Some people feel that smoking shouldn't be banned at the restaurants. In fact, it is a complicated thing. We cannot lightly say should or shouldn't. It influenced by many factors, first of all, it is difficult for government to control smoking people's quantity. And if there has supplies, there has needs. If smoking is not be allowed in the restaurants, what will the people who really want to smoking do? In case of myself, I think instead of smoking in our own seats, the restaurants should make some special places for us to smoking. It will not only good for smokers, but also the others. However, it's easier said than done. Only in reality we van know whether it is good or bad."
393,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I firmly believe that smoking in public should be forbidden by law. As we all know, smoking does harm to the smokers. But in fact, it also does harm to the people around the smoker, which has been manifested by the WHO. You can throw all cautions to the wind to be a chain smoker, and that's your right. But you can't be ignorant of the people around you in public. They have the right to do their things healthily in public, and they do not have the duty to be exposed in the environment which is full of those nasty smelling. No one will think you are cool when you are smoking in public. Instead, they may look down on you. Besides what I have mentioned above, smoking may ruin those students who are not well educated. They are immature and curious about everything and they may imitate what an adult do. So chances are that they also become smokers, which doesn't seem to be a good thing anyway. In a word, smoking in public is so harmful that we must put a ban on it. Only through the joint effort from the citizens and the government can we live a better city life."
187,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Whether students who study inside the campus can get a part-time job or not is a topic which is being discussed. Some students say yes to it because they think it can help them understand their parents' hardship while some don't agree with it, saying it's a waste of time for study. In my opinion, a student can get a part-time job on condition that it doesn't have a side effect on his normal study in the daytime. As a matter of fact, the good effects that a part-time job brings to a student should be more than the side ones because taking a part-time job can bring students more chances to get in touch with society. It's good for students to have part-time jobs because this helps cultivate independence among young people. Part-time jobs in business can foster a sense of competition, which is important for students in the future. And being able to earn their own money gives students a feeling that they've become adults and, therefore, makes them feel more mature. Part-time jobs make students more confident in themselves because through the work they can realize their own value and prove that they are capable people. What's more, it also makes students experience the hardship of making money. However, students who get a part-time job should control the time for part-time job as well as pay attention to their safety when they go to work. Besides, they should spend their income from the part-time job reasonably."

I strongly agree and advocate college students to find part-time job. I have the reasons and evidence to support my point. Finding a part-time job can make college students life more colorful and enrich their life. Moreover, doing part-time job they can gain experience which is the best way to their future career. They can gain the treasure to deal with various problems. Thirdly, it is a great opportunity to develop the ability to widen their work efficiently which will increase the quality of their career and life. Fourthly, part-time job can help us earn money. So we can reduce our parents' burden and buy something we like. For example, I even used some money from my part-time to buy presents to my mother. Last but not least, acquiring the ability to deal with many problems can also benefit them and they can make the best of the knowledge they have learned in order to get comprehensive development.

For example, they can't use their knowledge well and they have no idea about the economic situation. But the main point is that they lack the experiences about the society. So I think college students should do some part-time jobs. Life for a full-time college student isn't busy. They have much free time. Many students spend their leisure time in playing computer games or sleeping. This is a bad idea. Why not do a part-time job? It can not only supply some economic support but also provide some knowledge and experiences. The second advantage is really important. Most colleges or universities are open to the public, but the life in college is different to social life. Doing part-time jobs means that you can have a look at the social life and have more chances to learn social skills. When you graduate from college, you will find them so important to find a job and live a good life. For part-time jobs, it doesn't matter how much you can earn. The key point is how much you can learn. We can't learn everything in school. In my opinion, doing part-time jobs is a way of study. And the knowledge involved is even more important. So I think college students should do part-time job."

Above all, in my opinion doing a part-time job can help shape ourselves. During the part-time job, it's obvious that we may face lots of tough problems which we have never dealt with. Through solving them, we gradually become mature and develop good personalities, such as brave, hardworking and optimistic. At the same time, taking a part-time job contributes to earning a certain amount of money. As college students, most of us have been teenagers and are not children any more. We should learn to take the responsibilities to help our parents. Therefore, taking a part-time job is a good way to relieve the burden of our parents. What's more, taking a part-time job requires us to go into society. We all know that society is a good teacher. In the society, we can acknowledge the things which cannot be taught at school, such as how to communicate with others. In the meanwhile, we can also apply what we have learnt from classes to practical situations. In this way we can get a better understanding of the theories. However, we should keep in mind that we just take a part-time job. It ought not to be turned into full-time. After all, studying is our first task. We should balance the relationship between studying and part-time job."

Smoking helps them feel more relaxed and comfort. And some teenagers also smoke in public places. To them, smoking is cool; so they smoke to draw other's attention. People referred to above are selfish and foolish, they never think about other's and themselves' health. So I can't agree to their action. Knowing smoking in public places is harmful to others and themselves, why are there still so many people do like this? Smoking has become cultural in China. So even I think it must be stopped, but in recent years keeping the status in quo is somewhat acceptable. People must try to stop it and decrease this action. In the end, I manna to say that if anyone want him and his family to live longer and healthier, he just have to stop smoking in public places. Anyhow, smoking in public places is acceptable now; but it will disappear from china in the future."
027,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I support that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country because it does harm to all the people. The reasons lie in several aspects. Smoking in the restaurant is very impolite because the restaurant is a public occasion; many people are eating there every day. If you smoke, it will have bad effects on others. People will hate you and think of you as enemy. To leave a good impression on others, don't smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant is harmful to others. Besides, it is also affect your health because smoking can result in many diseases, such as cancer. When my grandpa was young, he smoked very heavily. Gradually, his health was threatened. This year he died because of lung cancer. The effects of smoking on others are more terrible. To protect all people's health, don't smoke in the restaurant. Smoking in the restaurant will impact the quality of air. If you smoke, the restaurant will be very dirty and nobody is willing to come. The restaurant will lose much money. Worse still, you will feel very uncomfortable. In a word, smoking in the restaurant should be banned. It is high time that we took actions."
396,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In my own point of view, it's not so important, as many people would think, for college students to get a part-time job. To discuss whether we should have a part-time job, we must figure out why some people would take a part-time job so seriously. After thoughtful consideration, I come up with three reasons with which they would put up. The first one, maybe the most important for someboby, is that it could help support you through college, lessen the burden of parents. As for the second one, I think it's that it provides the opportunity for college students to get familiar with the world, according to them. Most importantly, they believe that it could offer them work experience. However, I'm not quite for that. First of all, the students who devote a lagre part of their time into part-time jobs are not sensible at all, provided that money is the only reason why they do that. Parents support them with their hardwork, hoping you to obtain knowledge as much as possible, while you exchange the precious time for little money. Moreover, the university is a miniature society, where you could have access to the world. There is no need fou you to do a part-time job particularly to know about the society. If work experience, instead of knowledge, is what you really want, why don't you just drop out of school and find a full-time job? As a consequence, I believe that it's not necessary for college students to do a part-time job."
159,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿When I go to the restaurant, I always face the problem of smoking from people sit near my table. I don't like the smokers so much. I think that the government should ban people from smoking in the community. When I go to the park or the shopping mall, I always come across many smokers smoke and they make the awful atmosphere in the area. Smoking is a terrible thing for human health. It makes people be cancer and damage the lung. People who smoke may think that there is no harmful effect to the health. The truth is smoking is harmful both smoker and people who stay near the smoker. You can see from the advertisements on the television. They are trying to persuade that smoking is not good for the health of smoker and the people who stay near them. I think that the restaurant should not allow the smoker to smoke in the restaurants. We should not let the smoker go in to the public place too such as university, hospital, shopping mall, market, concert and movie theater as well. Finally, we must inform the smoker why we do not want them smoke in the public place because it will make people be harmful and unhealthy. If the smoker can decrease their cigarette per day they can have a long life."
397,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿From my point of view, it's essential for us college students to have part-time jobs. As is shown in some surveys, the percentage of university students doing part-time jobs cam be as high as 70 percent in some schools located in the prosperous district, especially those around the CBD. Alleged to a new survey I have recently read, many students have the desire to do part-time jobs from the bottom of heart. As above, we can see part-time job is fairly important, just as the meaning of water to fishes. Why are part-time jobs so popular in some way? There are some reasons probably explaining the puzzle. Among college students, nearly all are adults. Deep in their heart is a sense of independence, which means to support themselves as possible as they can. This is the most crucial fountain of the motive for us university students to have part-time jobs. Furthermore, it's part-time jobs that improve our comprehensive abilities and add to our social experience. Meanwhile, through social practice just like part-time jobs, not only can we make some extra money to support our daily life and lighten parental load, but widen out horizons and strengthen our relationship webs, which are very precious sources and will assuredly help us someday somewhere. What's more, part-time jobs covering some of our leisure time, we can shorten our time spent on boring things such as popular games, soap operas or chats. Part-time jobs make our life full in some degree. All in all, as college students, as adults, it's time that we went into the real society and did something. Part-time job can serve as a media or bridge for us, so why not seize the time and opportunity. Remember, time is flying, so is opportunity. Seize your time to have a try and you may be astounded."
162,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more college students are engaged in part-time jobs. They work in their spare time as private tutors, salesmen, waiters or shop assistants. People wonder whether it is good for students to do so. Some people are afraid that working in spare time will have a bad effect on students. Because they think study is the most important task to the college students. If they want to live a better life in the future, they should pay full attention to their study. Of course, their worry is reasonable. But there are also other people who believe that taking part-time jobs has many advantages and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, it is important for college students to take part-time jobs. Firstly, the students can earn money to support themselves and reduce their parents' financial burden by doing part-time jobs. Secondly, while doing their part-time jobs, the students can apply their knowledge what they learn on campus to their work. Finally, doing part-time jobs helps the students to gain some social experience that will be of great help to their future career. In a word, Taking part-time jobs provides students with more chances of social practice. However, college students should keep a balance between study and jobs because study is the first important task for college students after all."
305,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿One of the differences of college and middle school is the high fees. That means some of us may try to make money their own during college. But is it necessary? I think teenagers as we are don't have the ability to differ bad eggs from the goods. What's more, part-time jobs may take away our study times and drive away our attention. That may not worth the candle. So I think part-time job isn't necessary for college students. I have ever seen a story on newspaper which shows disadvantages about part-time jobs. Xiaoming was once a hard-working boy who always buries himself into study. But when he tried part-time jobs for just once, he saw the great economical receipts from it. He got off of class more and more frequently to do part-time jobs, so he can get much money which makes his life in college more satisfying. At the same time, his performance on class was worse and he also had less attendances. So when the final tests coming, he couldn't figure it out as well as he once could. And get a low score more than he could ever think. According to Xiaoming's sorrow story, we should know that even through money is important; it is not everything we should run after during the precious college time. There are other significant things we could do, too. Moreover, our college students are not mature somehow, and it can't be avoided to be treated by some experienced ones, some of whom may not be kind, too. So it may not be safe, if we take part-time jobs without enough cautious. All in all, I think it is not necessary to do part-time jobs for college students. For we should grab the opportunities to study hard, for we can take part-time jobs when grow up, but it is not easy to have another teenage after old."
236,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As for smoking, to most of us, maybe it is indeed a bad behavior. There are many reasons like doing harm to health. However smoking also has its own advantages. To begin with, it can relieve people's pressure. People, living in the 21 century, are always under pressure. That pressure comes from every thing, such as work, family matters, study, social contact and so on. So of course, people will use some ways to relieve their unhappiness. Smoking is just one of the most popular ways. When people smoke, they maybe can forget what enable them upset and worried, like drinking. Then, it can create large financial profits. No matter where it is, cigarette trade is undoubtedly larger than most trade, because the number of people using it is very huge. It can help a society or a country develop their natural economy. At last, it's also a culture. As many people use it for a long time, it has become a social habit. When people visit their friends, they may send a pack of cigarette. When colleagues enjoy a meal together, they may express politeness by sending a cigarette. Although it has its own advantages, smoking too much will cause more troubles. So I don't encourage people to take smoking as a living hobby. Use it in the special occasion and never get hooked to smoking, that's enough."
376,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Now at more and more restaurants smoking is being banned in the Smoking city. So it is debated if smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. However, different people have different opinions. As we all know, it is bad for ours health to smoke. So many people think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. However I think that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As a coin has two sides, smoking not only is harmful for our health but smoking little also makes people excited. If you are addicted to smoking, it is difficult to rid out of smoking. We should persuade them to smoke as little as, but not request them ban smoking. Besides, it has become traditional to give one cigarette to another at table in restaurants. So I think smoking should be banned in some restaurants where women and children would be but not all. In one word, I think Smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. People should learn when smoking is proper."
110,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country Smoking is a bad habit. It hurts our healthy and damages our lungs. It would give us a lot of bad effect. What's more? Smoking not only hurts ones' personal healthy, but also give others some bad effect. And restaurants are public place, many people can be influenced. As a special place, smoking should be banned at all restaurants. Another reason is that smoking is bad to society. Everyone hope to live in a beautiful surrounding. But smoker often throw matches and cigarette butts on the ground. And many people smoked in public. This will bring many troubles to surrounding people. As you know second hand smoke is just as harmful as first hand smoke and make damage to fetus and child. So smoking is not a personal problem. To society, smoking bring dirty environment, make stress among people and contribute various diseases.. So smoking is really a bad thing. It is effects everyone in public and influence many people. Just be banned at public, we can have a good environment to live and have a better restaurant surrounding to have a meal. I think smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country."
111,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. There are two reasons as follows. On the one hand, smoking itself does harm to people's health. The harmful substance which comes from cigarettes is not only bad for the smoker himself but also for the people around the smoker. A survey indicates that the person who smokes a lot has a higher risk of getting lung cancer which huge amounts of people die of every year. Besides the smoker, the people around the smoker also take in the poisonous gas into their lungs. So their health is threatened. On the other hand, restaurant is a public place. Everyone should take other's feeling into consideration. If someone smokes in a restaurant, the others will be affected. Because the smoke destroys the environment, it will probably affect other's appetite. Everyone is a part of the society, so it's our duty to think for others. So when we are in a public place, we should behave ourselves and be polite. What you do reflects your moral level. In general, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Do you agree with me?"
023,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I totally approve of this point. Being current college students, we should take an active part in the part-time job, if we accomplish our study task first. With the constant development of economy and society, everyone including students are faced with great challenges. Many students who graduate from university cannot find a satisfying job. They also suffer great pressure. Doing a part-time job can benefit students who will come into the society to some extent. First of all, students can improve their other abilities through the experience. Moreover, they can realize the society in depth. Besides, students are informed of the fact that the society isn't favorable to everyone. Those who long for a great success and a bright career must exert themselves to study hard. In this sense, students are alerted through the part-time job. Take me for example; I once acted as a waitress in a small hotel. During the period, I had to serve customers and take their orders. I served dishes and rice for them. And I was rather tired within these days. Though the pays was low, I was excited. I learned that everyone should spare no efforts to do something if they hunger for a better life in the society. I will enforce myself to study hard. All in all, there is point for college students to do a part-time job during the time in university."
245,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ Speaking of the topic whether college students should take part time job, opinions are often divided. Some people believe that students should focus on their study, while others feel that taking a part time job is necessary. As far as I am concerned, I prefer the latter. I can raise examples to support my viewpoint. To begin with, taking a part time job enables us to get a main idea of the society. We will leave our schools and walk into the society sooner or later. By that time, what we need is not only the knowledge, but also the skills and manners. Undoubtedly, the experience of doing a part time job will help us be familiar with these manners. Then we can sail through the ups and downs during our career life. Furthermore, doing a part time job is good to our study. Only learning the knowledge is far from enough, we also need practice. There is no doubt that doing a part time job is a great way for us to apply our knowledge to practice. Then we can get an idea of what we are short of, which can help us study better. Last but not least, doing a part time can form the sense of independent and perseverance, which is also of great importance to us. All in all, it is essential for college students to take a part time job. It does good to both ourselves and our job in the future."
244,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ University is filled with various of opportunities and students should grasp as many as possible chances to experience themselves and enrich themselves. So I can't agree more on that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, not only should college students gain knowledge from books and teachers, but also should abolish a lot from society. At the same time, they can gain much experience in many expects, from which they can benefits a lot for their future career. A part-time job makes a preparation for college students. Secondly, a part-time job can earn students a lot of money. During the course, college students can make a better understanding of that it is not easy to make a living alone. Also, they will understand their parents' hard work and learn to appreciate their happy life. At last, a part-time job can help students make a lot of friends, during which they can learn how to help others and experience the importance of teamwork. What's more ? Their friends may help them in the future. In brief, a part-time job can gain students a lot and help them harvest so much."
124,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿There is no doubt that smoking is one of the cruelest killers in the world. Until now, not only smokers but second-hand smokers suffer from the poisoned smoke and many diseases resulted from it. Many public places signs that No Smoking, but it doesn't work. However, I insisted that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. In my opinion, smoking is a direct way for suicide and murder. Smokers hurt their own lung and at the same time, the people around the smoker also breathe in the poisoned gas especially in the restaurants. Just imagine the situation that you are eating your delicious meal, but the table beside you give out a choking smoke, do you still have the mood to enjoy the meal? Then, based on many surveys, smoking can result in many kinds of disease which lead to death. Even the new-born babies are influenced by smoking. So who want to take a risk of getting deadly disease? Many men form a habit of smoking at a certain time, such as after the meal. They can't help doing that and the other people have no choice but to tolerate it. Above all, what should we do? As I think, the government should set a series of rules about smoking ban. Perhaps more importantly, we citizens should have an aware of reducing the smoke. It's being of great importance that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants at the country. Only with the power of law and moral, can we enjoy a no-smoking environment during our dinner or anything other."

Some people think that smoking should not be banned in restaurants because they are smokers themselves. They think smoking help them a lot in many sides. But, in my opinion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants. Here I'll give you some reasons of my idea. First of all, smoking is harm to people's health, not only to these smokers but also nonsmokers. Scientists have show that smoking can cause lung cancer, heart trouble, and so on. Smokers feel very happy when smoke after meal in restaurants. But doctors say it is very dangerous if smokers smoke after meal at once. What's worse, the harm to the nonsmokers who breath in the smoke is much serious than smokers. So non-smokers hate people smoke in the restaurants. Second, there are lots of fire accidents being caused by smoking in recent years. Some smokers throw the rest of cigarette on the ground. It causes fire and terrible disaster. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country. If we do this from now on, people will have a safe and clean place to have a good meal and enjoy themselves. Smokers can smoke outside if they want."
343,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I strongly agree with the topic that smocking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Some people would like to have a smock after meals, and we can always find many people smocking in the restaurant. As we all know, smocking does great harm to our health and second-hand smock is even danger. As reported, second-hand smock has the same possibility to cause cancer and children are sensitive to it. So when someone smocks in public places such as a restaurant, what great harm he will do to people around him. In the meantime, it is also not a good idea to sit in a fog when we have a meal. And the smell of second-hand smock is not very good which we would never want to smell during a meal. So I always feel upset when my father smocks after meals, which does harm to everyone's health and broke the atmosphere. Above all, I suggest that smocking should be completely banned in most public places as soon as possible in the country, especially at the restaurants. And the smokers themselves should also consciously keep the smock out of restaurants, and make a better atmosphere for diners."
017,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿What are college students doing at school? Study. Yes! But many would say that they are doing part-time jobs at the same time. Of course, it is of great importance! Apparently, most of us students are adults now. As an adult, it will be shameful for us to ask our parents for money. To be independent in economy is the perfect way to claim that we are independent individuals now! And we are never kids under the protection of our parents' arms! Secondly, and also the most important. Having a part-time job make you involved in the society. What people outside of school look like ?How they behaved? How hard is it for us to make money to support ourselves ?After went through all the difficulties we met, we will get a lot of experiences. When we graduated and also the next time we step into the society, we have the confidence to believe that we are already well prepared and we can do it. So, we will learn that money is not easy to earn and our parents are great. We ought to respect them and appreciate what they have done for us. I'm sure we will be more mature and more considerate to others. Doing part-time jobs is a way to see what life really means. Get ready to have a part-time job and try your best to prevent it making a bad effect on your study, and then you will get something surprised you!"
271,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ In my opinion, part time job is really good for the development of college students. Is can help college students is many ways. Firstly, part time job is a important way to built up our social skill. By doing part time job, we have to face this complicated world, we have to work with all kinds of people, we have to communicate with all kinds of people. These things force us to practise our social skill. Eventually, our social skill will be developed. Besides, part time job can offer us some social and work experience which is significant when we are look for jobs. Secondly, part time job can bring us some bonus money. The money is so important to those students who is not so rich. The money that from part time job could release the burden of their parents in some degree. Furthermore, part time job will make students more confident. By doing hard job, students will get the salary. The salary is the symbol of the their hard job. It can be seen as the attestation of their ability and intelligence. From the job, students will get the feeling of confidence. Thirdly, by doing part time job, college students will be more frugal. Because they will learn that it is not easy to earn money. Every buck may means a long time of hard work. For those students who waste money, doing part time job can be a good way to help them. Part time job is really a good way to help us."
330,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Long time ago, part-time was just a way for poor students to get extra earnings. In this way, they can reduce their family's press of preparing for such many fees. But then, looking westwards, we can find nearly every teenager has a part-time job, even when they are kids or in the kid gardens. Western parents trained their children in this way, and we find it acts out well, kids overseas can be more competitive than Eastern kids, they can talk, perform, and do things all by themselves, but as to eastern kids, growing up in the green house, always become a failure in the competition. Thus, as to college students, part-time job is a marvelous way to appeal to society and gain more abilities. In this way, they can stand on a stage and show that they are promising. Especially nowadays, it's hard to train a new comer in this field than to hire a experienced one, so when every company cares about your experience, and of course college students don't have, what can they do? Then the experiences of part-time job become important. So, as there are still so many laid-offs at present, what can we do to find a steady bow? Find a part-time job. In order to find a part-time job, we also need to know what we want, what we want to get in this part-time job, find a good one and share it with your parents, and they will be pleased to find that you have really grown up. Part-time job is also a good way for governors to deal with many problems, for example, as there are few IPO in China, college students may be the main power to improve its development. It is a large stage with opportunities for college students. Part-time Job is necessary for college students, not only for themselves, but also for society doesn't any kids, it just needs grown-ups."
156,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿College students have much available time and we have lots of free time arranged by ourselves. Which provide us more opportunities take part in university activities or some social practical activities apart from our lessons? I would like to make use of some time to do some part-time jobs to increase my social experience and improve myself which probably have influence in my future career? In our country there are more and more college students undertaking a part-time job or even more than one part-time job. It's becoming quite common to see students busy running errands after lessons. Some say colleges students are expected to do concentrate on studying, because study is just like their jobs. However, I think it's a good thing for college students to take a part-time job while studying. On the one hand, college life which consists of only study is not balanced and may cause the student to miss out on other valuable learning experiences. In addition to bringing more balance to a student's life, part-time work can broaden his social experience. On the other hand, it can make the students realized that it is hard to make money, And then they can change their bad habits. During this period they can know how much they owe to them. Part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families. For all of these reasons above, we should take some part-time jobs so that we can integrate theory with practice. I firmly believe that most students would benefit from taking a part-time job while they are at college if they can balance the job and study."
399,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Smoking in public shall be absolutely forbidden. Smoking being very bad for human being's health is nearly known as a truth. All of the smokers know it as well. They could hardly get rid of it just because they are used to it. For this, many products had been produced to help smokers to get rid of smoking. But still there are large quantities of smokers. I have been suffering for second smoking for long. My father is a solid smoker. He smoked before I was born. Now it is thirty years for his smoking age. When I was in the army, I bought him two sets of product to help him get rid of smoking. But it failed. So we can see how difficult it is to get rid of it. If we got the habit of smoking for the public smoking, what an awful thing it will be! Beside this, smoking could also lead to fire. Lots of examples told us that smoking in public is a serious reason for public fire. It may cause a great loss of public possession. For example, the big fire in the International Hotel in HaErBin, October Nineteen of 1985, which was caused by smoking, led to the death of ten person. Let alone the forest fire. All in all, smoking in public shall be forbidden absolutely."

Some students are in favor in taking a part-time job. They believe it can add up their experience and open up their mind. Some object to having a part-time job. They think it has the bad effect on their study. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the latter. Two main reasons may account for it. For one thing, working more outside campus means studying less in school. As a English major, we need much time on our specialized knowledge. We should spend spare time in practicing oral English, reading, writing, listening and so on. It takes up much more time to take a part-time job, so we cannot promise enough time to study. For another, taking a part-time job distracts us from our study. Since some students have done a part-time job, they pay less attention on study; even they cannot concentrate on listening in class. Gradually, those students lost the interest in study. It costs a huge price of neglecting study. In conclusion, having a part-time job has the downside on college students' study. Therefore we should focus on our study during the period of university; after all, we are students."
203,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿In my opinion, there's no necessary to ban smoking completely. It is known to all that it is not polite and appropriate to smoke in some public occasion. However, it is impossible to ban smoking completely at all the restaurants. Firstly, China has a long history of growing tobacco, so smoking also last for a long time in China. Smoking become a way of communication when people talk to each other, just as drinking, though both of them are not good to health. People have be accustomed to this way, and can not change the custom in a short time?a few years or tens of years. Secondly, restaurants are places for people to eat, and to smoke a cigarette after meal is most smokers' habit. We can not stop them doing this because that is their freedom. On the other hand, smoking may affect others' health, and that is why many people object smoking at restaurants. At this time, what we could do is to persuade them not to smoke, but we don not have the right to ban them. Thirdly, the solution of avoid smoking at restaurants may not be banning, it can be other ways. For example, the public dinning hall can be divided into two parts, one for smokers and the other for non-smokers. In that way, every one can enjoy his dinner. Anyway, I think smoking should not be banned completely at all the restaurants in China."

Have you ever thought what we should do to help our parents reduce their pressure? I think a part-time job is necessary. So far from we born, our clothes, our toys, our bikes, our computers, our breakfast, lunch, and supper etc., all of these things are given by our parents. They give us everything even themselves and we all know that we should do something to show filial obedience for our parents. But, how? We can do something what we can even it is very small. For example, help our mother do some housework or cook the dinner. And a part-time job is also a nice choice which can reduce their economic pressure. Many college students think that the main job of us is study and we are busy in our activities and study so that we have no time to do a part –time job. As far as I'm concerned, we have time to play games, spend time with our girl(boy)friend. We also have time to do a job. Even a part-time job will not give us much, but we can use the little salary to buy a gift for our parents to tell them that we love them. It's better than saying thank you. These are my opinions."
291,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Nowadays more and more people smokes. We can see people smoke almost everywhere, and they seems to enjoying the feeling of smoking very much no matter what reaction they come across when smoking. Personally I don't think it interesting or cool to smoke, because I like breathing fresh air. I simply can't understand why people feel good to smoke in some ""polluted"" air. I do know the chemical stuff that burned tobacco releases have the effect of chairing people up, but for most of smokers it is not the chemical reaction the reason that they smokes but the image of smoking people are cool and grown-up, others may be smoking because of stress from life, rare as it is, still others are truly addicted to tobacco. Money spend on cigarettes is a fortune to any body, but they spend it on cigarettes day after day, even though they can save it or do some business with it. Despite its wasting money character is not favourable, the critical point is that it do harm people's health. When you smokes, you smokes in more than the inspiring chemical; you also takes in stuff that released when tobacco burns. Imaging what it is like when a forest catches fire, you can see thick smoke comes from burned plants, and that is, just a little bigger, exactly the same kind of stuff you breath in when smoking. So, although you may say it's hard to cut off cigarettes, you'd better do cut off them for your own health and people around you."

Most of they want to be independent, so some of they chance temporary job. However, they couldn't think that they learn sciences from the books when they are young. In my opinion, they should learn more other things out of book. And then, I express my points. Students do a part-time by many different reasons, such as not well-off, buying some things, getting working experience. And many businessman like taking on them because of their low pay. Although the salary can make them happy in a short time, it has too low effect for the future. Some students chance learning more things in the teen time, I think it is well. They may be no time to learn some important knowledge when they are employment. They will get other skills what the same old person doesn't know by the day past. And they are more powerful then other people in the job. In my conclusion, I wish students get more skills, in stead of money. Because some skills can fill in their life, and lead them to get more money than part-time job."

Maybe someone show a negative attitude towards this behavior. They think it may have a bad effect on students' study. It is not real. Actually, having a part-time job can cause a rapid growth on students. The following are the advantages of having a part-time job:First, students have a lot spare time in college. They have fewer classes, so it is necessary for them to make good use of time. Compare with playing games on Internet, companying BF or GF, it is more meaningful to work. Second, it will help students wide their eyes. By working for others, students will understand more to society, know how society works, and gain more experience, preparing better for their future. Third, as we all know, a job will be paid. Working can have a extra income for students, so they don't need asking their parents for money all the time. In one word, college students will gain a lot by having a part-time job. It gives a new way for students to learn more about society."

When they have a lot worry, they will smoke. But I think it should be banned completely at all the restaurants in the country. First of all, restaurants are public places. When the smokers smoke in the restaurant, I think they don't consider others' feeling. Restaurant is a place to eat food. Everybody wants to have a good appreciate. But if there is someone who is smoking, I think we can't have a good time to enjoy our food. Secondly, smoking not only harms to smokers, but also harm to others. Smoking can cause than 1000 deaths of lung cancers. Second hand smoke affects women, children, and elderly people. Scientists also suggest people to smoke less or give up smoke. If smokers want to smoke, they must go out the restaurants or at home. Thirdly, a banned can help encourage smokers to give up smoke. If it isn't allowed to smoke in the restaurant, they can smoke less than usual. Also they can have a good time to enjoy their delicious food. Above all, I think smoke should be banned at the restaurant. Do this is not only good for smokers themselves, but also good for people who live near with them."

Don't you believe? Ok, now, let me give you some in brief. As the first of it, the part-time job is a job. So you can get reward if you do it carefully. Every time I get the salary in the end of month, I am always feeling so excited for it is exchanged with the sweat of mine. Don't think the money you earned is too little and isn't worth to mention. As I know, part-time jobs for students are very worth for in fact you didn't create much value. And at the same time, you never spend much time on it. Meanwhile, you can get much experience from it. For example, as you work, you are gradually learning how to communicate with the boss and how to cooperate with other workers. More importantly, it's a very difficult-getting chance to learn to deal with these problems you come across when you work. And for you are a student, anyone else will patiently teach you how to solve these problems. But when you really begin to work, no one will be willing to waste time to teach you. The last and the most important is that you can get into the society through this way. And then you will gradually to see the society through and try your best to adapt to it. Some time later, you will find the ability of society-communicating has a great improvement. So, why we don't have a part-time job right now?"
120,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As a college student in grade 2, I think to find some part-time job to do is an excellent choice. And I would like to present two explanations for this. The first reason can be seen by every person. There is no denying that we have been adults, that the reason why we need to shoulder the social responsibility. If we try some job in the free time, not only can we earn some money to reduce our family's burdens, but also the job time in the weekend can enrich our life. At the same time, I think if your weekends have too much spare time, why not choose this meaningful activity instead stay at dormitory and addict to computer games?On the other hand, by the time we do part-time job, it can also give us some experience about the out-side world. When we finish our 4-year study in college, we have to enter to the society in the end. In my opinion, the experience we accumulated during the part-time job will play an important role in future. In conclusion, I think to do some part- time jobs is the best choice for college students. In my class some boy have began to try to do some easy job, like put out ad paper. And I believe there are more and more college students select this way to practice ourselves"
012,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿According to the Chinese governments' announcement, smoking will be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country since Jan. 1, 2011. People have been discussing heatedly heather this ban should be taken into effect since the news came out. Of course, for non-smokers, it is really beneficial to them. But for smokers, they think it is too strict and unrealistic. Personally, I approve of it very much. First of all, for many customers, who spend much money in going to the restaurants, they just want to enjoy a nice meal and have a good time here, but with the irritating smoke surrounding them, how can they feel comfortable? What's more, as we all know, smoking does harm to not only the smoker himself, but also the people around him, whom we usually call second hand smokers. On one hand, the burning tobacco smoke contains more than 20 kinds of toxic hazards to life, among which the nicotine is the largest killer that can increase the risk of heart disease and lung cancer greatly. On the other hand, scientists find that non-smoker experience psychological harm as well, when they are exposed to the smoke, their levels of depression and anxiety is increasing. Eventually, let us look at the statistics showing that thousands of fire accidents are due to the litter of non-extinguished cigarette ends, not to mention the related deaths and losses. So, mo smoking, no crying!Taking all the factors into account, I stick to the ban that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."
080,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿As far as I am concerned, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants as fast as possible. Masses of reasons can be listed. First, smoking is so harmful behavior that it not only harms smokers themselves but also a lot of innocent people like us. As we all know, the smoke contains countless poisonous gas, which can easily result in cancer. Second, restaurants are public places. We are supposed to attach attention to our own behaviors for the simple reason that what we do has an impact on others, especially like smoking and other disagreeable manner. The smoke makes us hard to breathe. Besides, people who go to restaurants tend to enjoy the nice food and comfortable atmosphere. However smoke definitely ruins all the things we longing for. I am convinced that while enjoying their meals no one wants to be crowded with choking clouds of smoke. Apart from the reasons listed, there is one thing we cannot ignore—safety. It is a common sense that a thrown cigarette butt is an object with high temperature, which can contribute to a fire. To sum up, it is never too late to forbid smoking at all the restaurants with the intention of public's health and safety."
029,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Many college students now are considering taking a part-time job, especially for the freshmen, who have amount of time and energy. In my opinion, taking a part-time job broadens our horizon and brings us a lot of fundamental skills in life. So I agree with the opinion that taking a part-time part is important for college students. I have the following reasons and arguments to support my view. On the one hand, Chinese students are always considered as hard-working examples but it seems that we lack the power to practice. Taking a part-time job, during which we can learn how to communicate, work and live with people in society, is beyond peradventure good for our growing. College life must be more than just study and we should focus more on personal development. On the contrast, a student who spends all his time just reading books and finishing homework, no matter how academic his, may not be admitted by companies. Those students are not as mature as these who have experience in jobs after graduation. So why not take a part-time job? We all should take the chance of the days without too much homework and take a part-time job to develop ourselves."
081,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Restaurants are always supposed to be a place that people can completely enjoy their meals, relaxing their feelings. But let us assume the situation that when you are eating the delicious food. Suddenly, there a man breathes out with the smoke, so you may not want to sit here anymore. Smoking can bother others, and should be completely banned at all the restaurants. China has a large number of smokers. As nonsmokers hate the social phenomenon, they hold the view that smoking should be banned. They complain that they inhale the second-hand smoke in public that would greatly harm to their health. As all of us known, smoking is bad for people's health. It can cause lung cancer, lead to respiratory problem and heart problem. And diseases caused by the second-hand smoke are even more serious. Nonsmokers shouldn't be responsible for it, while the smokers should think about more for others. Banning the smoking in the restaurant is to build a better atmosphere for nonsmokers, and also for the smokers, in order to have a good time to eat. It is a problem related to the ethic, which means to consider more about the others' rights, not only thinking for you. Although, there is not a clear law to forbid the behavior, but it counts. It calls for all the people to do something to help!"
168,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Now in the universities more and more students take a part time job. There are many reasons that can explain these phenomena. To start with, many university students think a part time job is necessary. First, they can earn some money through the part time job to ease their parents' burden. Second, they can communicate with people out of school and learn much knowledge in the society. Doing a part time job can widen their field of vision. The experience of doing a part time job will do well to them when they find a job after gradating from the school. What's more, there are also many people who against a part time job. They insist that one's time is limited. If a student spends much time on a part time job, he or she will pay less attention to his or her study. And the society is too complicated. Students should not enter into it when they don't have the ability to deal with it well. Last but not least, as far as I'm concerned, we should make a good attitude towards the part time job. As a student, what we should pay most attention to is our studies. Then in we spare time we can do some good part time job, such as a tutor. That may become good experience in our university life."
153,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think that smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants. Nowadays, smoking becomes more and more popular in almost every situation. No matter at home or in public places you can always find that someone is smoking. The air is filled with smoke. I hate smoke and smoking, so I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in public places especially in the restaurants in the country. Firstly, smoking is bad to smokers' health. It will shorten their lives. What's more, it will do more bad to the people around. Their families, friends and others will be forced to smoke. This would be a quite terrible thing. Secondly, smoking in the restaurant can be even worse. When other people are eating and drinking, the smoke flies to them, around their nose, mouth even the whole body. They will feel extremely angry and terrible. Many people used to smoking when dining. You can often see this scene: a man is drinking with a cigar in his hang. This action is not cool but impolite to others. Above all, smoking so harmful and terrible that we should ban it the restaurant."
335,SMK0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿ I think it is essential that smoking should be banned in public places. My supporting ideas are as followed. First of all, smoking is harmful to our health. The more we smoking, the poorer health we will get. Smoking, in a way, is just like taking drugs. So, the less we smoke, the better we will be. Smoking damages our lung. It adds more possibilities to us to get lung cancer which will finally lead to death. So it's more sensible for us to keep away from cigarettes. Secondly, parents are children's first teacher. If parents become keen on smoking, it will have bad effect on children and their future. They will get more possibility to abandon themselves to smoking when they grown up. Lastly, smoking in public places not only damages your own body, but also destroy other people's who around you. Scientists point out that people who smoke second-hand cigarettes get more chance to get a cancer. So all people's health are under threaten, including those who don't smoke. Why do they have to pay for that? They are innocent and have no responsibility. In order to be fair to all people, smoking should be banned in restaurant. So I think not only in restaurants, smoking should be forbidden in all public places."
206,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I don't think part-time job is important in college life. First of all, as being a college student, we still have lots to learn and we have no idea what we are capable of. Because of this, we usually choose very simple and meaningless part-time jobs like waiters and cleansers. Truly we can earn some small pocket money through these jobs, but in the same time, the precious time that we lost just equals the value. In order to spare the time, I prefer to make a good use of the library which is definitely great treasure for us and we very likely won't be able to have access to the large amount of knowledge any more. So why don't we treasure the time and the utilities now, so that we can arm ourselves with broad sight and knowledge. About the working experience or the society experience, I think these are ought to be realized after graduation for we have plenty of time to deal with the society, like 5 decades or even more. I'm sure that at that moment, we must be very tired of work and always like to looking back to our campus life which should be pure, full of activities and enjoyment, maybe piles of books we have read which brings us wisdom, or maybe an unforgettable girlfriend or boyfriend. Whatever it is, it will never be the job. Compared with the work time, school time is so short, I hope I can enjoy my school life to the largest extent and leave no regret!"
060,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, unemployment increases sharply, more and more people can't find suitable jobs. Doing a part-time job can help us find us a job in the future. So I think it is important for college students to have part-time jobs. For many college students, there are much more time for them to spare. Having a part-time is a good choice. College students can get experience and information about employment by having different jobs. For example, if you have a part-time job as a waiter, you may meet different kinds of people, you can learn the best way of communicating with people surrounding you. Besides, you may find your part-time job's advantages, disadvantages and future. It will help you find the most suitable job for yourself after graduating. A part-time job is a very vital part in a college student's daily life. But it can't influence our study. All of us have to admit that study is the most important task for college students. Only can we launch a part-time job in our spare time. That is to say we should pay attention to both study and part-time job at the same time."
207,PTJ0,B1_1,CHN,"﻿Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? It's becoming a controversial question recently as more and more college students do part-time job in their spare time. Those people, who hold that having a part-time job is essential for college students, emphasize that through part-time jobs, students can learn professional knowledge better. For example, the student who is major in computer takes a part-time job in a computer company, he can learn the knowledge that doesn't exist in books and at the same time he can realize there's still a lot to learn so that he works harder and harder. What's more, the part-time job provides them with experiences that can't be taught in a lecture hall. They think that the knowledge learn from schools is insufficient. So it is helpful to attend this kind of social life to get social knowledge. It seems that part-time jobs act as warm-up exercises for students to take full-time jobs after they graduate, and help them prepare for their future careers. The students who have the experiences in part-time jobs will be more competitive when they find job. Last but not least, the part-time job can offer the students whose families have financial problems enough money so that they can study until graduating from college. Others, on the contrary, will of course opposite and, they believe that the most important thing for student is study. They argue that college students are too young to face up with the complex society and it's also a waste of time. According to me, the benefits will certainly outdo the drawbacks. However, it depends on you. If you can deal the relationship between working and learning well, I'm sure that you can succeed in the end."

Not only are more people join the smoking family, but the number of people, who are smoked, is rising rapidly. We need to do something to stop it. In my opinion, banning smoking in the restaurant is exciting. There are several reasons to it. To begin with, how terrible the smelling is when a person is smoking beside you. The disgustful feeling will last for a long time in our mind. In addition, restaurants are the place where people eat food. You can imagine when the cigarette dust fall down to the food, we may be sick later. According to the science book, we know that there are lots of bad things in the cigarette. They are really harmful. Many people get diseases because of smoking. Last but not least, establishing a friendly-environment society becomes a developing trend, and banning smoking can be the first step. So we can see that the reasons above can all show that banning smoking in the restaurant is a wise choice. May be the government can do something now."

Many people believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. But I disagree with it. I have some reason to support my idea. Firstly, I hold that everyone should have the most important thing to be done in the different period. To be a student, study is the key word for us. If you cannot study well, you waste your time. Secondly, lots of students want to lessen their parents' financial burden through taking a part-time job. But it has a bad effect on their study. They do not know the most important thing their parents respect is that they can learn well and live a better life after they graduate. Therefore, pay much attention on your study now. The most important thing is not to have a part-time job right now, learn professional skills and practice yourself is the most serious thing in the university. If you want to earn more money, this will really help you later. So don't be influenced by others and try to keep on learning knowledge and you will succeed in the future."

I share the feeling that it is beneficial for college students to get a part-time or extracurricular job. My thoughts are divided into three points. Firstly, there is no doubt that getting a part-time job can make up our daily fees. Even though our wages are not enough, we can also use what we earned to pay for bills. That is to say, we will be proud enough to announce to our parents that less money is Ok and we have grown up. Secondly, it is really rewarding after seeing our struggles are given such cheerful values in return, which makes up and builds up much confidence and perseverance. Armed with them, we will become braver to face the unpredicted challenges. Enriching our social experience also belongs to the benefits of holding a part-time job. It is universally acknowledged that our society is becoming more and more complicated and filled with heated competitions. Before stepping up to the society, if we own more experiences, we will enter into and adapt to our society quicker and have more chances to manage our future. Of course, doing a part-time job maybe will consume our time. But using a little free time can get enormous benefits, why not take it?"
026,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿I disagree the view that smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. My evidences are below. That smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants does not fit with the reality world. Because a lot of men smoke now, which smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants is impossible at the present. If smoking is banned in all the restaurants, many men maybe against that smoking is completely banned in the restaurants. Many men who smoke think that it is not reasonable to ban smoking in all the restaurants. And those smokers will not go to restaurants will bring trouble to the restaurants. They will have business problem. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants, it is harm for the interests of the restaurants. All the restaurants will give way to men's attitudes. Although smoking is not good for health of people's, men don't want to give up smoking. They say that smoking help them many ways. Some say that they fell happier by smoking and forget troubles by smoking. All the restaurants will allow men to smoking, for all the restaurants want to get more interests. I think maybe we can do other something to solve smoking problem in the restaurants but not completely ban smoking in the restaurants in the country right now."

Some students say that university students should not take part-time jobs because the part-time jobs will reduce the time students spend on study. Others argue that part-time jobs help college students to learn more that cannot be taught in the textbooks. Both sides have their own reason. Then, is it a good thing for college students to work part time? In my opinion, college students should take part-time job on the condition that they can handle their study. First, part-time job is a good way for college students to have a better understanding of our societies. There are so many things that students cannot learn in classroom but jobs in societies can. Like the abilities to find a job or to get along well with your boss. These things can only be learn in the work places but no classroom. So college students can benefit a lot of social skill from part-time jobs. Second, it can promote students' study through part-time job. They learn more things about their major from part-time job. What's more, students who are poor and suffer financial burden can make money through part-time job. There are many students cannot afford college tuition. So, part-time job is an important way for poor students to relieve their family burden. In conclusion, if students can do well on their study, it is good for them to take a part-time job."
188,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Many years ago, the European has claimed smoking should be banned in the public places. This law considers smoker's health and the people who don't smoke and the place making. There is an argument about whether smoking should be completely banned at the entire restaurant in the country. In my opinion, it should be banned. Firstly, we are aware about how bad smoking is for our health. Smoking causes cancer, and heart disease. It can shorten your life by 10 years or more. So, smoking too much is bad for your health. You should consider your health. Secondly, in the restaurant, there are a lot of people. It affects the health of others. Second hand smoke contains hundreds of bad chemicals. This also causes their health problem like cancer. Non smoker should not suffer this unfair treatment. For secondhand smoke cause more danger than the smoker. Finally, smoker also spends large numbers of money. The money in smoking can be used in many useful ways. It can not be just used in such way. Indeed, I don't agree with people can smoke at the restaurant. In the public place, you have the right to smoke, but you should consider other's felling. If you can't quit smoking, you should find a place belongs to you for smoking. Please don't smoke at the restaurant."

So it is becoming common to see college students selling products in the supermarket or cleaning dishes in the restaurant. However, it is truth that for a college student his most important goal must be to learn well and to get a high score in examinations. So many people oppose university students having a part time work but in my opinion it is important for college students to have a part time job. First university life is consist of lots of parts and do work is one of them. So part time job shouldn't be rejected by us. Second do a job has advantages for college students. They can broaden their social experience. Maybe a student who has a part time job will get better conversation skill. Besides they are also able to save the money which their parents send to them every month or they can use the salary to buy something they like such as changing a new phone. In addition, work helps a student to develop greater independence and team-work spirit. So all of these reasons above, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part time job."

Firstly, in my opinion, there are some restaurants have two parts. One is the smoking area and another is non-smoking area. I believe it is a good way not to influence people not like smoke if smokers smoke in the restaurants. We can have more restaurants like this. So we need not ban smoking completely in all the restaurants in the country. Secondly, it is unfair to force people smoked for a long time not smoke in the restaurants. If all the restaurants completely ban smoking, how can they have meal in all the restaurants? In China, many people smoke with people in the restaurants to do business. If it is completely banned, they will have problems for business. Thirdly, restaurants ban smoking will not attract smokers and they will influence their business. If I smoke and the restaurants ban smoking, I will go to the restaurants any longer. How can earn money?Last but not least, many smokers throw cigarettes everywhere in the restaurants. Some people say it is very dangerous because many fire happen because this."
064,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿According to the scientists, we know that smoking is a factor of lung cancer, but is it necessary to ban smoking in all the restaurants over the country? To be honest, I think so. First of all, smoking may kill smokers gradually. The nicotine must be the murder. Smoking may makes smoker constantly cough and it can't be stopped, both smokers and their families have to tolerate their cough for a long time. If they are not lucky enough to defend themselves from cancer, their family have to face a tough future and take care of them. Then, have the smokers even thought about the people surrounding them? While they smoking, other are forced to have second-hand smoking. Everyone do thing and affect others. They can make people surrounding them fell sick, can't enjoy a meal, especially the children, they haven't grown up, nicotine will make a damage to their young bodies and their brains. Smoking in restaurant may make others sick more quickly. The smoke will spread around the whole restaurant. People have to get touch with the pollution through foods and drink. So, don't smoke in restaurant is everyone's responsibility. But if they don't agree, government should do things to ban smoking in all the restaurants."
202,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿In my opinion, all restaurants in China should not completely ban smoking. Instead, it is necessary for most restaurants to set a smoking area to serve smokers and other restaurants to completely ban smoking. Although the majority of people support the assertion that smoking is harmful to smokers and people near them, in reality, there are still great amount of people in China who are smokers. Once all restaurants begin to ban smoking, smokers cannot stand the period in restaurants without any cigarettes. As a result, it is possible that large groups of heavy smokers give up to eat in restaurants and instead begin to eat at home or buy fast food, which will course great reduction of restaurants' profits. Thus to look round the corner, it is reasonable for restaurants to divide themselves into smoking area and non-smoking area, then smokers could enjoy their cigarettes after finishing their delicious dinner without complaint from non-smokers while non-smokers could appreciate their dinner without smoky air. As I know, the Show Coffee is among those restaurants which first begin to set smoking area and non-smoking area in China, which is largely welcomed by its customers. In addition, there are special restaurants with limited room for the division of different areas. Under this situation, all the customers' health is much more important that the smokers' addiction, so runners of those restaurants should completely ban smoking without any hesitation."

First, what college student can learn from by dong part-time job is that they can get the experiences of working. As everybody knows, the situation of finding a job is so hard in the present. So, the experiences of working for a fresh graduate is so valuable. Second, doing a part-time job also means meeting more people and you will make many new friends. Then, your life will become more funny and happier. Third, when doing a part-time job you may get your characters changed. You may become more out-going and talking while you were shy and even never dared speaking in public. In the last, or the most important point for someone, doing a part-time job can make money to do what you want to. For example, my friend who is working for library every weekend use his money which he get from working to have bought a series of stamps that he is always wanting to collect. So, there are so many benefits to do a part-time job for college student. Let's start to find a part-time job!"

First guy said his work and family that gave him much stress, and smoking seemed to be the only way for him to release the pressure. Otherwise, smoking has been such as his best friend and he could tell it everything what he want to say. Second guy also had the same reasons that like the first people. In addition, he thought if he could smoke a good cigarette, it seemed to be that he was a rich man as well. So I thought smoking was a way to show one's riches. Through the analysis, I think smoking at all the restaurant is nothing but harm. There are three reasons to support my ideas. First, smoking usually is bad for our health, and if he or she is smoking at the restaurant, the smoke will spread out all over the restaurant, and other people also will be smoked. Second, through a good cigarette to show off one's riches is not a good social mode, we should ban this bad social mode together and encourage people not to smoke at the restaurant anymore. Third, restaurant is only a place where some people can eat food or chat with others, if you are smoking at the restaurant, you may affect other people to eat food happily. To sum up, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."
289,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ Part time job is becoming more and more popular. Many college students take part time jobs to get money to pay for the university or get some work experience. I think, part job is necessary for university students. First, part time job, in my opinion, is not just a way for money, it is a way to get work experience and learn about the society. Today, employees want not just your high grades, but also your work experience. Suppose that there are two persons wanting a job, one has a two-year part time job experience and the other has never worked for others before, the employee is sure to hire the former. So, part time job will help you find a better full time job. Second, part time job is also a way to get money. In the past, it is our parents who pay for us, but now we have grown up. It is responsible for us to make money ourselves to help our parents. I think parents will be happy to see that we can make a live by ourselves. Third, taking a part time job can help us make some friends of all kinds. Today, friends can help you a lot. They can give you good advice or they can help you when you get trouble. Part time job will let you know a lot of workmates, and they maybe your friends. From all above, we can see that a part time job is really necessary for college students. Some of my classmates have already taken part time jobs. So, find a part time job for yourself, it will help you a lot!"
099,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Recently, there's a heated discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job, Different people have different opinions. Some people think that college students' most important task is studying, not making money, while other people do not agree it. In their opinion, college students should learn not only book knowledge, but also other technologies. Frankly speaking, I don't like having a part-time job. Because, it occupies amount of my part-time and I have to pay much of my attention and energy to it. But, I do agree that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job. Here are my reasons. Firstly, having a part-time job can bring us some financial income. This is the most visible benefit. We can lighten the burden on our family by doing some part-time job and improve our own living standard. Secondly, we may get some social experience which is useful to our future job-hunt. Thirdly, we can learn a lot of skills through doing part-time job. The college students are all good at book learning. But, most of the students are lack of practical experience. So, I think, it is necessary to have some part-time job to improve our mixed ability."
139,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Today, we can see more and more young people smoking in the public places such as street and restaurants and so on. However, I don't agree with this behave. Some people think about complete ban of smoking in all the restaurants. I agree with it because it is a good idea to do it. There are two justifications listed below to support my argument. First, smoking does a lot of harm to our health. Smoking cause a lot of disease such as lung cancer and it harm the non-smoker more than smoker. When eating in a restaurant, the non-smokers have no place to go if smokers smoke around them. What's more smoke does harm the environment in the restaurant, it causes the air pollution and something else in the restaurant. How can you enjoy your meal if you eat in this restaurant?Second smoking may bring fire to people in the restaurant. It may cause fire when someone litter the cigarette around and the worst thing is the fire burn the house and hurt the people in the restaurant. So we should against smoking in the restaurant, since it brings a lot of bad things to us. Finally, I appeal to all people to give up smoking not only for you but your family members."
210,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Yes, I think so. Since we are now college students, it means not only studying hard, but also working hard. After graduating from the college, we are to step into the society. If we don't have any experience about how to work well, how can we live on? Having a part-time job just means getting more experience about the job and the society. At the same time, we can make money for our everyday life, and save money from our parents. That will make our parents happy. As is known for all, having a part-time job requires us to balance study and part-time job well. That can practice our management skill of time. Saving more time means living longer. If we can manage our time well, we can have a much more efficient life. Moreover, we can practice our communication skill. Nowadays, the level of communication skill leads to the level of your success. If we can communicate with others well, we can make many friends, and they can help us when needed. With the help from our friends, we can succeed more easily than on our own. So, I agree with college students having a part-time job."
323,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Recently, our teacher have given us a topic about weather people can smoke at a public place. In my opinion, the answer is certain no. The reasons are as follows. Firstly. Smoking at a public place will make the environment of the public place become dirty, What' more, the cigarette ash have much hazardous substance which will pollute the environment. So, smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the environment. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non-smokers. Secondly, at a public place, there are many people who do not smoke. so, if someone smoke at a public place, it will hurt other peoples' body. meanwhile, the strong-smelling of the cigarette is quite terrible to many other people who do not smoke. As we all know, cigarette have a lot of carcinogenic things. Therefore, that the government ban smoking at all public places is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. Some smokers often say that it takes away some of their freedom. But I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the public places. All in all, people should not smoke at public place, which is no denying."

So the question about college students doing part time jobs has been heated discussed. As teens, almost adults in terms of age, we not only have the energy but also have the faith that to feed us just by ourselves, which is also the signal to being a true adult owing respect both from the family the school but from the society. So trying to find some part time jobs to do is sometimes regarded as an important step to enter the society. But at the same time, we can't make it good to find the suitable job or solve other problems as we are faced with the society at first time and have little experience. Also there are many cases on the crime that teens were used to do terrible things by some adults. What's more, if students use more time in studying, they may get more than washing dishes. So to sum up, we are supposed to think twice before we want to get some part time jobs."
282,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿College is different from high school. We enter the college not only for our further study but also to practice ourselves, experience society for the future and make ourselves ready for entering the society. So some social practice is necessary for us college students, and doing a part time job is a good choice. Part time job can enrich our life in the college. When we are changed from a high school student to a college student, we may find that we have more free than ever. We are not locked in the classroom to review the boring textbook all the day any more. Sometimes we even feel that we have nothing to do after we finish our work. And part time job can kill our empty and make our life more colorful. Part time job can also improve our communication ability. When we take a part time job, we need to communicate with many other people that we don't know before. We need to satisfy our boss and make our workmates feel pleasure when they are working with us. So we have to talk with them often. Gradually we may know how to communicate with others better. Besides, taking a part time job can make us more confident. When we get the money that we gain for our work for the first time, we must feel happy and proud. We recognize that we have the ability to make a life. So we may be more confident. So why not try to find a part time work? And then our college life must be more colorful."
097,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all in the restaurants in the country. I will explain it in the below. For one thing, as we all know, smoking is harmful to our health. According to the number of statistics, smoking is one of the biggest killers to the human being's health. Every one of us including the smokers should spare no effort to resist the cigarette. Therefore, banning smoking is absolutely right. For another, smoking bring harms to not only the smoker himself but also the people around him, that is to say, the people all around the smokers have to pay their health !Why? This is unfair! Taking that the restaurant is a public place into consideration, the smoking will do harms to more people! The restaurant is a public place and there are all kinds of people including the children. I think nobody wants to answer the children's question that ""Why they do smoking? Should I do the same thing? Why?""If you were smoking in the restaurant and there was a kid asking you the question, how and what will you say? Without any doubts, both of the kid's body and psychology are affected. In a word, if we are blind to the problem, smoking in the restaurant will do more and more harms to our society. It's the high time for us to take actions!"
136,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿In recent years, more and more college students in our country prefer to have a part-time job. Still the quality is increasing. However, is it important for them to have a part-time job? I think so. On the one hand, most college students are adults now, so it is the right time for them to have a part-time job besides their study. They should behave like other adults to raise themselves rather than asking their parents for a lot of money. Through the part-time job, they can get a lot of experience and their ability will be better. Nowadays, most companies prefer to give an interview to choose the able one, instead of offering training afterward. It is safe to say that a person whose ability is better is easier to find a job in the future. On the other hand, students who take a part-time job will be better to understand the society. They will meet a lot of people, doing a lot of things like other adults and so on. From doing these things, college students' minds will be changed. They can get readier than others before they actually enter the society. In conclusion, for our college students, having a part-time job is important."
049,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿You can see the college students everywhere; most of them have a part-time job. The reason why the number of students who has part-time job is increasing is that having a part-time job has three benefits. First, about the money. As is known to us, a lot of college students are suffering from the money for study and living. Having part-time job is a good way to earn money. They can use their own ability but not ask parents for money all the time. They can make a living by themselves because this is the first step of being an adult. Second, about the experiences. Most of college students are not familiar with the society. If they have a part-time job, it will be a good chance for them to know more about the society. They can gain a lot of experiences during the job. Third, about the relationships. Students can only meet students or teachers at school. But when they have a part-time job, they can meet a large number of different kinds of people, such as businessman, officer and so on. They can teach you things that you cannot learn from school. You can set up your relationship with others. In summary, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
072,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Smoking is a common activity in everyone's life. No matter who smoke, you cannot always avoid it. And the attitude to smoking is varied from people to people. In my opinion, smoking should be limited but shouldn't be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. And I have three reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, smoking can make people relaxed sometime. Especially for many businessmen under heavy stress, they need a convenient way to relax themselves. Smoking just can help them and keep them in a good condition. Secondly, for sure, smoking may be unhealthy to the smokers and the people around them. But smoking or not smoking is a private choice; we can't completely forbid it in all the restaurants. Just set a special place for these smokers in the restaurants can solve the problem too. Thirdly, if the smoking is banned completely in the restaurants, it must lead to terrible destroy in the cigarette industry. Many workers may lose their jobs and it will influence the economy of our society. So in conclusion, smoking should be limited in the restaurants but not banned completely in the restaurants. We just try to have a special place for smokers in the restaurants now and it will do less harm to non-smokers."
327,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿There is no doubt that part-time job is important for college students! At least I think it is. Because I'm a college student and I also have a part-time job at my university. Ok, let me tell you the advantage of having a part time job. First, you can earn some money from the part-time job. Though sometime the reward is not as much as we expect, anyway, to have is better than not to have. If ones family is poor, well, such money maybe a great help to his or her and also lower burden of the parents. If ones family is not poor, he or she can use the money to make the life better. Apart from the money, there is something we can learn which cannot be studied in book or bought by money. That is experience. The experience own to yourself and the experience can make you do better in the job. What is more, the experience may have a permanent affection of your future development. Whereas some college students think it takes a lot of time. So the time of study would be reduced, isn't it a loss for us? Surely, seldom the part-time jobs for the college students take much time. The worry is absolutely unnecessary. Consider above, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job."
140,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Nowadays, taking a part-time job is very popular for college students because it has many advantages for them. There are some reasons for my opinion. First, students have much free time in universities. They should spend their time doing things that are beneficial for them, rather than wasting valuable time playing computer games, sleeping and so on all the time. Taking a part-time job can make their college life more meaningful. Second, they always take money from their parents when they have no money, which result from their bad habits of using money. Now, it is time for them to understand their parents' working-hard supporting the whole family and learn to use money reasonably. At last but not least, college students have learned much theoretical knowledge from textbooks, but they lack practical ability to solve all kinds of problems. So, taking a part-time job is a good chance to practice them and gain useful experience in society. In my opinion, it is very necessary for college students to take a part-time job. If they want to gain success, and then they had battle to make arrangements ahead of time. So, they can take a part-time job, from which improve their ability and accumulate experience."
092,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿It is important for college students to have a part-time job. As we can see, nowadays the social competition is becoming fiercer. Every year there are more than five million college students graduate from school, which deepens the employment stress. Many graduated students can not find a job easily if they lack working experience. What's more, as the economic crisis has made great damages to the economy, many firms broke down or survive hard, which lead to the result of drops of employment rate. Today, only improve our ability greatly, can we survive in the society. To improve working ability, taking a part-time job is a good choice for college students.

386,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿I think it's necessary for us college students to have a part-time job. We all know that part-time job is important for students. There are four reasons can account for my ideas. Firstly, we have adequate time to do it. And, to some degree, having a part-time job doesn't cause bad effect on study. On the contrary, it makes us to study more efficiently and quickly. Secondly, we should learn to be more independent gradually, and having a part time job can help us to form this ability. Although, the sum of money itself maybe is not very large, but the meaning it contains are far over it. And, I believe you must be very happy when you get the wage, aren't you? Thirdly, we can enter into and touch the society earlier than the ones who stay in school all day, which is important for us definitely. For we have working experience rather than not experienced. And, experience in job hunt has great significances. All in all, I agree it's necessary for college students to have a part time job."
041,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿In recent years, many people are talking about whether or not to ban smoking in restaurants. As far as I'm concerned, smoking should be banned in all the public places including restaurants, because it has a bad influence on the health of people. On the one hand, smoking make many people get disease. We know from books that smoking harm people smoke and all the people sit around them. In some magazines, some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous sometimes. Many people die because smoke second-hand smoke. In the restaurants, people smoke is harming people have meals in the same place and at the same time. On the other hand, smoking makes the air in the restaurants terrible. In our country, many times I have meals in a restaurant and someone sit close to me smoke. It makes feel uncomfortable but I don't know what to do. I am sure that smoking is harmful to everyone. There is no denying that if smoking is banned in all the public places like restaurants most of us will breathe in more fresh and clean air and have a happy dinner. So we will not worry about smoke in the restaurants any longer."
044,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿As we can see, having a part-time job becomes more and more popular among college students. From my perspective, this phenomenon is good. It is really important for college student to have a part-time job, as a part-time job may let students gain more experience, can help understand the knowledge, and can let college students know how hard can we earn money. Firstly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because college students may gain plenty while working. They learn how this job goes, and they learn how to work with colleagues and their boss, and also they learn to be confident. For me, I worked for a TV program as a translator for a month, and I got those I said just now. So a part-time job is really important for a college student. Secondly, it is important for college student to have a part-time job because they can practice what they have learnt in college. Practicing is the only standard for testing truth, and practice more can also help your study. When I was working for the TV program, I really learnt a lot. I have to say that all the things I learnt there was really useful. So if a college student wants to gain more go and have a part-time job. Lastly, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because a part-time job can help them establish the conception of money. They will learn soon how difficult to earn even 100, and they will understand the value of money, and furthermore, they will understand their parents. In a word, college students can grow through part-time job, and they can practice more, and what is the most important, they can establish a right conception of money."
045,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ I do not agree with this point. Maybe some people think that taking a part-time job can help themselves in many respects—explore the knowledge outside the books and even gain the financial independence. Three are still other students who think that part—time jobs will have strong negative influence on study. And the work, which often makes a student under strong pressure and burden. And this will make students join fewer college activities. In my opinion, I think students should pay more attention to study than part—time jobs. And part—time job is a small cheese for students. For college students, time is very limited and valued. If students spend their limited time on part—time jobs, there is no doubt that they have less time to study. So they have little time for their college activities. If someone think part—time job will give them extra earning, I am certainly against it. College time is not a proper period to earn for students. It is a best time to learn varied knowledge. In case they gain some money now, they will lose a lot of money in future. To summa up, college students should not take part—time jobs when they study in college. Part—time jobs just make student lose their ways in heart. For students school work is more important than part—time job. Knowledge is power."

Some people like smoking when they thinking about something. They said sometimes inspire will come across in their mind when they smoked. Moreover, some young adults smoke just because it looks cool. It is because smoking have so many advantages that lots of people are addicted to it. However, on the other hand, smoking's disadvantages are much more compared to advantages. One of the biggest disadvantages is that smoking is very bad to our health. It's said that if you smoke a cigarette, you will live several seconds shorter. Because there are much harmful substance in cigarette fog. If we breatheit into our lungs, it can easily cause lung cancer. Besides, if we smoke, our families will smoke second-hand cigarette, and this is even much more harmful. What's more, the bad fog will pollute the air.

For instance, it helps him to realize that no success comes from nothing. It enables him to be independent and builds up his self-confidence. What's more, part-time jobs can get the students out of the ivory tower and give them the opportunity to get along with different kinds of people, get useful working experiences and learn the value of labor. Besides earning some money to support themselves, they can learn a lot which cannot be learned from textbooks. As everything has two sides, the disadvantages can't be ignored. Part-time jobs cut into students' study time; some even become so occupied with making money that they can't focus their attention on studying. In the end, these students may fall behind or fail in their studies. In my opinion, students can choose to take up a job according to their own situation.

Not only experts but parents suggest our freshmen or higher class college students to have experience of part-time jobs. My father told me that part-time job is a challenge; and I will be confronted with difficulties. Whether the difficulties the part-time job is, which is not significant to concern. We only try, devote emotion and to be hardworking is enough. Thus the more effort we make, the more we will gain. The essential thing is that we can learn how to manage a work and succeed. Furthermore, taking part-time job is paid. Money always is a motion for working.

When one smokes a cigarette, one is actually burning money. The smokers do not agree. They believe that smoking can helps to sharpen their mind and prevents one from sleeping, especially when they are working on a hard work. Also, the government gets lots of money from cigarette taxes, and these money can help us to make our country better. I am not a smoker, and I don't like smoking very much. But, I argue that the smoking should not be completely banned at all the restaurants. It's not realistic for preventing every smoker from smoking. As we all known, everyone has his right to choose the style of life by himself. And, of course, no one has the right to impose his way on other people. So, in my view, the smoking should be banned in all the restaurants but not completely. In other words, we should give multiple choices to persons. In some areas of restaurants smoking should be allowed, and if you are not a smoker or you don't like smoking, you can choose the no-smoke-area of restaurants."

In addition, we rich our experience which can only be get from the real work environment. On the other hand, we shouldn't take much our attention on it because we now are just student not workers. And if we haven't known enough fundament acknowledge, we can't do well in our part-time job. Do not forget that the study can help the work while the work can help the study. To obtain much acknowledges is the main mission of our collage student. How balance the study and the work is the challenge for our freshmen. So the plan is most important.

I have some reasons to prove my point. Some people think there are some advantages if students take part-time jobs. They think that many students gain experience from part-time job. Some people even say they can have practice some good characters. On the other hand, students can earn money from doing part-time jobs. If they are from very poor family, they can reduce their family burden. But after-school work has brought a lot of problems. For example, some students all the time think of their part-time jobs and cannot decide study is more important now. So some students now have some problems with study and some even don't go to class on time. As for me, I think the main task of students is to study hard and learn important knowledge.

They are unwilling to challenge themselves and reluctant to do it. They think their first task is to study rather than a part-time job. What's more, some students say that they are busy. I believe that the so-called busy is just an excuse. Personally speaking, a part-time job is quite necessary for a college student. College is no longer like the high school. It's a place whose purpose is to cultivate independent and intelligent person. So if you have more time after you classroom time, try to take your chance to find a good part-time job.

That's really upset me! But sadly, I have got used to it. It is impossible that they will stop such kind of thing. Because restaurant is a place that all kinds of people can get in, especially some people who have smoked for many years, it is hard to tell them that they cannot smoke when they have meals.

Because when we take part-time jobs, we can practice to communicate with others, which we can't learn in the school and we will have a chance to see what the society is earlier than who don't take part-time jobs.

However, some people say that it takes away some of their personal freedom. In my opinion, stopping smoking in public places, also including the restaurant, is really a wise idea. As far as I am concerned, I think this is a good rule. Firstly, smoking which leads to some diseases like lung cancer is harmful to our health. What is the worse, many people around the world died because of smoking. Besides, it is not surprising that smoking will pollute the environment in the restaurant by giving poisonous gas off into the air. In addition, banning smoking in the restaurants can increase waiters' working efficiency. Smokers won't interrupt their work all the time to smoke. What is more, some people who are allergic to smoking in the restaurants cannot bear with the gas, which makes them sicker. However, many smokers complain governments have no rights to take away their freedom of smoking in the restaurants. I consider if they want to smoke, they may smoke in private, not in the public. They had better give up smoking because it is beneficial to both their health and environment. I believe if smoking is banned in all the restaurants, most of us will breathe in more fresh air. Only in this way will our healthy condition be improved."
024,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Recently, there has been a discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are two opinions about this question. Some people think it is good to have part-time job. But some other people don't think it is good to do it. I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have some reasons. Some people are agree with this sentence. Firstly, if they have a part-time job, they can relieve their parents' burden. Besides, it also can increase their chances to practice in society. However, some people object this opinion. They claim that part-time jobs will waste student's time and affect their studying. Therefore, they just need to work hard. As far as I am concerned that students should have a part-time job on the basis of working selectively. For one thing, by working they can keep themselves well informed of as much knowledge as possible. For another, without selection, some working that everyone can do will waste our times. And we will learn less. Also it will make working ineffective because of we don't do the job which we should do. All in all, it is necessary that we should have a part-time job and have some selection."
117,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿In my opinion, It's very necessary that smoking should be banned in the restaurants in the country. In fact, I have many reasons for this view. As we all know, the world has a large number of smokers. They like to smoke anywhere include public places such as restaurants. Some smokers say that smoking can help them get away from stress, make them feel good, they said they enjoy the meals better after smoking. However, they didn't know that smoking is bad for their health and to others' health. It can cause lancer, and lead to heart problem. When people smoke in the restaurants, those non-smokers sit close to them become the victims. Many scientists say second-hand smoke that would greatly be harmful to people's health. Moreover, everyone hope to have meals in a clean restaurant. But smoker often throw matches and cigarettes on the ground, and this will bring many troubles to surrounding people. It can even cause fire disaster in the restaurant. According above statements, smoking should be banned in the restaurants because smoking is harmful to health, bad influence on non-smokers and the safety of people. Banned smoke can bring us comfortable eating environment in the restaurants."
116,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Smoking is always an action that be found everywhere. It can bring a bad effect to all people. And, it should be banned in public first. There are several reasons. First I think, smoking can do harm to our healthy. It can bring a bad disease——lung cancer. According to the statistics, there are 600 000 people died of lung cancer every year in china. And 85% people would be died once they have it. So smoking is a way of killing in a slow way. Smoking should be banned, and we have no time to wait. Second, smoking is a special action, it not only destroys smokers healthy, but also hurts others body. Because the air which be polluted would be draw into their lung. And restaurants are public place, and there are so many people who can be hurt by smoking. It is so important to take actions to make smoking is banned at public, of course, at all restaurants. Today, more and more people know it is important to improve their environment of lives, and the first they should do is to make their air clear. So I think Smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, and also we should take action quickly."
021,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Some people hold that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. But I don't agree with this opinion. I have some reasons to support and explain my opinion. For one thing, everyone has his own hobby. No one likes others to change their hobby. Somebody likes to smoke, so we have no right to refuse them to have dinners at restaurants for this reason. For another thing, the restaurants are public places, smoking at public places is not good but we can do nothing but advising them. However, the restaurants' owners can leave a room for those smokers. When they want to smoke, they should go to that room for them. This can separate smokers from most customers and I believe more and more customers will be interested in this restaurant if you do like this. So by this way, both smokers and other customers are happy with this method in the restaurant. So it is difficult to completely ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country because we can do other things for this problem. But as we all known, smoking is an immediate threat to health; it can cause seriously cancer. So we all had better smoke less."

When we in university, did we need to and should have a part job My idea about this question is that it has to be decided after clearly know oneself. As we all know each people is different from others. Firstly, our dreams are different. Some examples, some want to be a normal worker, and some want to be a scientist. Secondly our experience is also different, some have known our society a lot, but some have not known our world will; some can communicate with others easily, but some can not. So we have to make our own decisions. Maybe someone around you has a good reason to get or not to do a part job, but you had better to think about yourself after know yourself really. On the other hand, we must know what a part job can bring to us. A part job can give you a place to work, can bring you some money. It also can let you have a good chance to improve your skill. And we also have to get an opinion that a part job would do harm to you at the same time. Having a part job, you would have less time to study, to play basketball, to read the books you like and you want to read and so on. To have a good knowledge of yourself and what you meet with is very important. A part job is a just a part job, do not let it bore you. And you only make your own decision. you should and have to do what you like."

Smoking is not only harmful to the smokers themselves, but also brings many trouble to others. Smoking in public places even can make others smoking. There are millions of Chinese people dying from smoking each year. The number of people dying from smoking is far more than that of drinking each year globally. Smoking is harmful to many organs of human being. Smoking often will bring about lots of disease, and shorten our life. As far as I can see, smoking should be completely banned in public places (such as restaurants, classroom and so on) in our country. The city will be more harmonious and more beautiful than ever. Of course, it is a habit hard to give up for those long-time smokers. So some special places which is for smoking must be built in the restaurant. There exists a long history for smoking. We must keep our respect to those smokers who should have a free right to choice. One day, when there is no smoking in the restaurants, in the buses, and so on, we will be happier in our life."
066,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿There is a perception that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I consider it reasonable. I have some reasons below. First, the majority of the college students is grown-up and has the ability to take up a part-time job. Second, our college students should know the uneasiness of making money and take the responsibility to afford our own living expenses and help to share the family burden with our parents. Besides, we can get some working experience from it and make a better preparation for our future career. The more experience you have, the more attractive you are to the employers. No one will need a person who only has theory knowledge but without practical knowledge and experience. Furthermore, we can acquire some living skills and learn more about life and society while working so that we can survive the society with fierce competition and live a better life. In addition, we can get more chances to get along with people and communicate with them. In a word, we can learn much from doing a part-time job. So we can say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Try to find a part-time job when you have time."
059,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿More and more students have part-time jobs when they study in college. I have a mixed feeling about it. In my opinion, it depends on different situations. On one hand, some students are not good at their studying and they should pay more effort in their homework and previewing. For these students, it's not wise to have a part-time job. On other hand, most students have no barrier in their studying. It's not enough for these students to study theory in college. They should practice more and use their learned knowledge in practicing. The best way to practice is finding a part-time job and there have two benefits. One is students can get experience from job which is beneficial for them to find job. The other one is they can earn extra money from job and it can strengthen their ability in independence. In addition, most students who has part time job have the problem that how much time they should spend in their job. It's important for students to deal well with this problem; otherwise it will make a bad influence in their studying. All in all, students should choose carefully whether or not to find a part-time job."
058,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ I think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job. Entering colleges means children's growing up. Students should try to learn as much as they can during days in colleges. Because this is the time you needn't worry about too much life problems and have many chances to obtain new things. Especially in China, students have little time to do things themselves before being a college student. College time is good time to become mature. We can feel much through earning money ourselves. On the other hand, we can collect much experience. All this is good for us. There is always a time when you have to make a living by yourselves. The more practice how, the easier the challenges that future has prepared for you will be. What's more, many people destroy their future for the lack of enough things to do. These people feel bored and don't know what to do after being set free suddenly. Then, they do some no-meanings to pull the time like playing computers day and night. They then form many bad habits. Finding work is good way to stop this from happening. So, college students of course should find part-time job."

In contemporary world, we can see many No smoking signs in public places, such as in the bus, in the hospital and so on. However, there are still many smokers or smoke addicts. They will feel uncomfortable if they don't smoke. Whether smoking should be banned at the restaurant? The question has sparked an immediate debate. Some people argue that restaurant is also a social occasion. Many businessmen tend to talking about their business when they are at the dinner. It is unavoidable for them to smoke. Beside, smoking is a personal thing, and others don't have the right to interfere with them. However, quite a lot of person advocates that smoking should be banned at the restaurant. Now that restaurant is a public, smoking should be banned. If many people smoke in the restaurant without limit, the environment in the restaurant will become worse and worse so that people will not have a good motion to enjoy the delicious food. The restaurant should keep consistent with the hospital and bus. Personally, smoking should be banned. If the practice is formed, many people will follow it. Smoking is not only bad for smokers but also bad for the restaurant environment."

Students who have a part-time job are easier to be accepted by enterprises. To modern enterprises, diploma is not the only way to text the employee, working experience is become more and more important when a leader decides whether the employee to get the job or not. For example, a graduate with high diploma but no working experience and another with a common diploma but have rich experience, which one would you like? If I'm the leader, I'll choose the second without hesitation. Maybe someone will oppose me, students' duty is study, isn't it? I think that's middle school's students' duty, and college students' duty is not only study but learn more principles when you live. Have a part-time job is a good chance to learn!To me, I really want to have a part-time job, but I never find it because I'm too lazy. I think many students just like me, they are to lazy to have a part-time job. In a word, I'll try, if I find a job fit me, I'll do that!"
071,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿I think that smoking cannot be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. Since late 16th century, tobacco has been popular worldwide. A large quantity of people fell in love with this mysterious material. Smoking can really bring exciting feelings. So many smokers cannot live without it. That condition causes a series of problem such as lung cancer, even air pollution problems. Based on an idea that makes life healthier, some governments and professionals put forward an advice that smoking should be completely banned in the public places like restaurants. In my opinion, smoking is a very troublesome thing. But I hold the view that we cannot ban smoking completely in all the restaurants in the country. First, many people now cannot live without cigarettes or tobacco and they want to smoke before the meal and after the meal. That is to say, they need smoking in the restaurants also. Where will they go if smoking is completely banned in all the restaurants?Secondly, in fact some countries' economy relies on the tobacco production. If smoking is banned completely in all the restaurants, tobacco production will reduce and economy will be influenced. Therefore, we can choose to only ban smoking in some restaurants for people's health or we can divide restaurants into two parts. One part is for smokers and the other part is for non-smokers. I think do it is more practical. And some day gradually, we can ban smoking completely in all the restaurants. But not now."
216,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿As everyone knows, smoking isn't good to our health, so dose smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants ? It is said that smoking is harmful not only to our health but also to the air. Smoking can lead to many diseases, such as lung cancer. Smoking affects non smokers more than it does smokers. According to a survey, the rate of passive smokers getting ill is higher than that of smokers. So, many nonsmokers are against smoking. In restaurants, the harm of smoking is greater. It's not only bad to themselves and worse to others but also it pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off into the air. Therefore, that the government ban smoking is very necessary and important to us. It is a measure to protect our health and environment. So many people, especially nonsmokers are for the policy. Some people may say that it takes away some of their freedom. I think it is a one-sided view. If one wants to smoke, he may smoke in private, not in the restaurants. In fact, smokers still have the freedom of smoking. But, I think, smokers had better give up smoking, not only in private places, but also everywhere. It will be beneficial to all of us."
198,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ In my opinion, it's important for students to have a part-time job. But I argue that the job must be a proper part-time job. There are many advantages for a student to have a proper part-time job. For instance, a proper part-time job can help students to realize that no success comes from noting. It also enables students to be independent and build up their self-confidence. In addition, a proper part-time can make the students out of the ivory tower and give them lots of opportunities to know more of themselves and the society. In the same time, students can realize their personal value in society by having a proper part-time job. Of course, as we all known, everything has two sides. If we do not know the balance between part-time and learning, something bad will occur to us. In other words, an improper part-time job will bring many disadvantages to us. For example, an improper part-time job must occupy students' time and make them just pay their attention on money but not what they should to learn. In a word, a part-time job is important for the students, but the students must keep a good balance between part-time and their learning."
038,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Generally speaking, I don't agree with the idea of topic B, which smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Now, I like to talk about my opinions: To begin with, it is a right for people to smoking in the restaurant. Restaurants are public place for all customers, so everyone has no qualification to limit it. What's more, people should observe the law, and cannot do the thing what they want to do. In the next place, we can build a smoking room, for those people who are already addicted to smoke. In this way, protect smokers' personal right. And when smokers eat in the restaurants, they will not disturb other customers. Then, the quantity of cigarette sold will be decrease, thus it will affect the economy of society immediately. On the other hand, The last point, this ban will not only arise smokers' negative mood, but also lead to social trend. Some smokers think that smoking can help them solve difficult problems and relax their thought. In the end, to draw a conclusion above, I strongly believe that smoking shouldn't be banned at all the restaurants in the country. We can take some other ways to solve the problem of smoking in the restaurants."
039,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿In my opinion, smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the country. I have some reasons to support my idea. Smoking is an unhealthy habit. Because it contains the fired soil and something that can causes the cancer. And it also destroys their bodies. Those smokers usually have some diseases. Having smoked for a long time means that they are killing themselves day by day. And what is more, it is obvious that the people who eat with them breathe the same polluted air which leading eaters have no interested in what they taste. Also the smoke is harmful to their health too. If the law of banning is through, the atmosphere of restaurants will be more perfect. And the good smell of the delicious food but nothing else is full of the whole room. The more fresh air they breathe and the less smoke they take, the longer life they will have. The cleaning of public places not only the restaurant should be kept. So they including the dining room should be completely avoided from the smoking. If all the restaurants clean, I believe more people will benefit. So all in all, government should do something to ban smoking in all the restaurants in the country now."
310,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ As far as I'm concerned, part-time job is necessary for college students at present. Because taking a part-time job dose have many advantages. Here are some of them. First of all, college students themselves have the required skills. Compared to senior high school students, college students have much more leisure time and they are older so that they can take good care of themselves. They can do whatever they want to do without the permission of parents and teachers. So they have the time and ability to take a part-time job. Besides, as a college students, we should learn to be independent from our parents. We can make some money by taking a part-time job. At the same time, it can provide us with some experience which is necessary in our life. It can also be fun and interesting. Last but not least, when we take a part-time job, we will meet many people who take varieties of jobs. Dealing with these people can improve our communicate skills and lay a basic foundation for our future career. Of course, whether taking a part-time job is up to you. If you are busy with study, you don't need to take it. but if you have the time and urge and the will to challenge yourselves, you'd better have a try."
045,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Absolutely I agree with the point. Restaurant is a place for people to have a nice dinner with their family. Smokes will destroy the warm atmosphere. And this also do harm to people's health. Someone may say that whether smoke depend on personal preferences, this is selfish behavior. It will make other people be unhealthy. The important thing is smoking can shorten one's life. It's very terrible. Personally, I do not like those people who smoke in public place. As is known to all, smoking just make people increase the risk of cancer. And those second-hand smokers will be more influenced than smokers. Especially in public places, smokes are extremely harmful. Smokes are poison gas. If there is no one smokes in restaurant, people will enjoy themselves more and more. The law may make smokes give up smoking so it is also benefit for them. A professor called Peter in HK university said＂one cigarette can kill at least 50 mice＂. You know, smoking just make people feel boring but no benefits. In conclusion, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and people should do this well themselves. We have an obligation to make people more health life."

Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, because smoking is bad for health, and smoking in restaurants put bad effect to other people. Also, we need to build a more harmony society. First, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking is harmful to our body, especially while smoking in a restaurant. As we all know, cigrette equals poisson. But we can't ban cigrettes, for the contribution to the economy given by the cigrette company. So what we can do is to stop smoking in restaurants to protect people from second-hand smoke. Second, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because smoking in a restaurant may annoy other people. From my perspective, smoke in public is rude, for smoking is a kind of private behavior, and many people hate the smell of smoke. So smoking in a restaurant may let people feel unhappy. Last, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country because we need a more harmony society. According to what has been mentioned above, smoking makes other people feel uncomfortable, physically and mentally. Therefore, it is against what we are seeking—a harmony society. In that case, to get a better image, to build the civil society, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. All in all, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country, due to smoking in restaurants is harmful to our body, our mental and our society development."
386,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿I don't support the idea of banning smoking completely in all the restaurants. Though I think it's necessary to set up some bans to limit the smokers properly. We all know that smoking is bad for health, not only for the smokers themselves, but also the innocent second-hand smokers, like me. For the health of us, the smokers should consider the non-smokers. And in return, should non-smokers also think for the smokers? If on some conditions, their smoking does not affect us much, why must we set up so inflexible bans. For example, not all the restaurants are crowded in all the time. Maybe sometimes, restricting people by moral is more efficiency and comprehensive than the law. I think smoking is a generation problem, and we can not carry the smoking bans too far and too widely. To some degree, smokers also have the right to smoke, isn't it? Maybe some of us are addicted to the computer games. I think what computers to us are what cigarettes to smokers. It's not hard to imagine how difficult it is to control smoking, let alone throwing it completely. My father is a smoker, too. And for my health, when being with me, he never smokes. Sometimes, when he really wants to smoke, he will go to a corner to smoke. All in all, I don't agree the idea to ban smokers smoking in all the restaurants."

In my opinion, college students to have a part-time job are not necessary. I can list some reasons to explain my opinion. The first, although the study of college is relaxing, but it's also need to study hard. For student, every second is important. If we have time to do part-time job, why not spend these time to study knowledge?The second, most of college students don't have much social experience, they are cheated very easily. And they don't have ability to keep themselves out of danger. I think the school is very safe, if the students go out to work, I can't imagine what danger they will face with. The last but also important, nobody can guarantee the part-time job will give students too much value experience. But on the other hand, it's very well for students to join the school club activity. They can chat with each other who are also students; they can spare happiness with each other's a very good thing. All above, the part-time job is dangerous and unnecessary for college students. Maybe students are curious about it, they want to try it. But I think the knowledge of book is also interesting."
058,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ I don't agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country. I will list my reasons. First, even though people know smoking is not good for health, many people still can't help smoking. As smoking spread so widely among every level of people, it is nearly impossible to ban smoking in all restaurants. Secondly, we know that smoking too much can cause lung cancer, which can destroy the function of lung completely. But sometimes, smoking seems to be able to lighten the hurt of heart. So it is likely that smoking can be accessible to most people. To me, I think restaurants should be divided into two parts. One part is where people can smoke, while the other part is where people are not allowed to smoke. In this way, most people's needs are met. The people who smoke while having a meal won't trouble other people who hate the smelling of smoking. And smokers can smoke if they like. Imagine all restaurants banning smoking, smokers must smoke outside or just control themselves. Smokers don't like this. Now, as most rich people smoke. Big restaurants don't like this too. So we can do something for the problem but not complete banning."
059,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Many people don't like smokers smoke around them when they are eating and they think smoking should be completely banned at restaurants. I partly agree with this opinion. For instance, if a person eats alone in a small room in the restaurant, he has the right to smoke. Eating with your friends together in a small room in a restaurant, you also can smoke if you friends don't mind. But in most situations, smokers frequently smoke in restaurants and don't care other people's feeling. Even smoking is more harm to people who sit around smokers than smokers. Because smoking produce nicotine which is harm to people's health and people who are forced to intake nicotine have a second smoking, professionals say people who have a second smoking intake nicotine more than smokers by about 13 times. In this case, it's necessary for government to make a policy that people can't smoke in public restaurants. Take Chinese smokers for example, most smokers don't listen to waiters or waitresses' suggestions when they keep smoking in restaurants. Generally speaking, different countries have different problems in the aspect of smoking. Whether or not completely ban smoking in the restaurants should depend on different situations."
087,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Whether is it important for college student to have a part-time job or not? This is a great problem. There doesn't exist a common answer. Firstly, we must have a clear understanding of University study, which includes theoretical study and practical experience of learning! Of course, we have a large number of chances to do the theoretical study. But the practical learning isn't the same enough. A part-time job is a kind of social practice that gets material and spiritual rewards by paying physical and intellectual labor to some specific organization or individual. So a part-time job occupying reasonable time benefit us. However, we must remember clearly all the time that the main purpose of our college life is studying which ought to take most of the time. So no matter how many you can get from your part-time job, keep yourself studying most of the time. Always remember that studying well is the largest expectation of our parents. As a matter of fact, we will have many chances to participate in social practice. In short, take a part-time job only when you can master all of your courses. For us college student's focus on learning is the most important."
066,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Should smoking be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country? My answer is that it depends. To begin with, it is not good to smoke in public especially in the restaurant. What do you think if you take a mass of smoke from other tables when you are enjoying your meal at the restaurant? Restaurant is a place where people should obey the public morality. As we enjoy the personal liberty, we ought to respect other people's rights and not to harm their rights. If you do not, you will suffer from others' disgusted look and public blame. In addition, some people cannot help themselves smoking in the restaurants. It will harm not only the smoker's health but also other's health. It is not fair for other non-smokers stay in the same restaurant. On the contrary, smoking is a personal habit and liberty. And everyone's legal liberty should be protected. People can get relaxed and release themselves from smoking. Those who have a hobby of smoking will be unsatisfied if there is a law to completely ban smoking at all the restaurants. To solve the problem, we can do other thing. In my opinion, smoking and non-smoking areas can be set in the restaurants so that both smokers and non-smokers can enjoy themselves."

But some non-smokers would de forced to smoke when they are in the public places. Why? The reason is that some smokers make much poisonous gas in the air when they smoke. So in order to bring some clean public places to people, smokers please do not smoke in the public places. Public places belong to everyone live in our society. That is to say that we all have the right and duty to keep the public places clean. As not throw rubbish, not rob of others, we also should not smoke in the public places. At the same time, we also should to think about something for others. Health is most important for we all human, no one would like their health to be harmed just because they have walked by the public places. So this is a good reason that should be used to remind you not to smoke in the public places. Just like what the front words say, smoke in the public places would harm you and some other people. On the other hand, if you not smoke in the public places, you are protecting yourself and others. When you want to smoke in the public places, please do not."

Some of them hold that part-time jobs can help them to adapt to the society well and give them many experiences. Take a friend of mine for example, when Lily was a college student, she went to supermarket as a promoter or went to be a family teacher every weekend. Then owing to her experiences, she quickly got a good job after graduating from university. in the other students' opinions, they think that they can buy goods they want their parents cannot afford. I know a student that he goes to a restaurant as a waiter at his part-time to earn enough money what a computer needs. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job. However, our parents always don't agree us to get part-time jobs. They are afraid that our study and safety. In my opinion, having a good part-time job is good for students. We should pay attention to the advantages of part-time jobs and make the most of them. Meanwhile, we should learn to get knowledge from the part-time jobs and make them a helpful tool for our development."
391,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ NO SMOKING, you can almost see it everywhere. As the technology develops smoking has been hated by more and more people. It has not been a simple of fashion but a enemy. Smoking is bad to your health, which I need not say. However, many people agree this point. But they have another idea that just smoke once will not make a big different to their health. I have to say that is true. But if you smoke once everyday, or even every half day, it can destroy your body easily and many people can not stop when they have smoked once. Keep away from cigarettes is not very hard if you have not smoked. But it is not easy to do so if you have smoked for a long time. But I hope that they can control themselves because it will also be bad for other people who do not smoke. Even they do not care about themselves, for other people, they should stop smoking. Wherever you are, smoking is not a good thing. Not only for yourself, but also for other people. I believe you can get a strong body and more friends if you do not smoke."
184,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿In the modern times, it is accustomed to having a part-time for almost college students, and it plays more important roles in their life. Having a part-time job is good for college students because there are some advantages for college students, There are many advantages for college students to take part-time jobs while they are at college. Firstly, part-time jobs could offer us good chances to make money to pay for everything we want, even for our education and shopping. Besides, it is not surprising that part-time jobs help us become more independent of our family. Last but not least, we are able to relieve our family financial burden. What is more, we can develop our social skills and gain experience which may be of great importance to our future career through part-time jobs. What is the most important thing is that taking part-time jobs can open our eyes and make our college life more colorful. From my perspective, as a college student we should keep a balance between the part-time jobs and studying. Although taking part-time jobs bring us many benefits, we must realize that studying is our first task so that we should pay more attention to it."
116,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ College students are a group of special kids. They are independent and have a particular view to our society. To such a group of people, having a part time job is a thing that can express their values. I think it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are three reasons. At first, having a part time job can make college students know more about our society. With the development of society, competition becomes more and more fierce. How to have a good ability to do more, part time jobs give a chance to take advance to step into the society, and learn more to be a businessman. And second, having a part time job can help a lot of students whose families are not very well. Maybe it can make them go to university, and have a better meal. What's more? Having a part time job can give you confidence and a sense of accomplishment. It would be important for one who wants to grow up. So, in my opinion, having a part time job is important for college students. And it can give us more than we can think. If you want to have a part time job, ok, take action!"
117,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. And in my opinion, it's beneficial to the students. First of all, taking part-time jobs make young people more independent, which is important for their further development. Next, students who have part-time jobs can afford their fees for their schooling, which in fact relieve the burdens of their parents. Then the most important I think, students can train themselves for future with a part-time job. The most things we learned for future is what we learned from the society instead of the school. Because what we learned from the society is what we are going to face. As we all know, in China, many students can't find a job because of their lack of social experience when they graduate from college. Last but not least, as friendship can provide you an easy way for future, we can meet more people from a part-time job and many of them can help us. However, I do not mean that high school study is not important, but all in all, I think there will be more advantages to have a part-time job when you are studied in the high school, because you can get trained earlier and more friends."
024,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, it is generally accepted that smoking is becoming more and more of a problem in our country. This phenomenon brings great damage especially smoking in the restaurants. So someone think that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants. And someone doesn't think so. I prefer to the former one because I have some reasons below. There are many reasons accounting for my idea. On the one hand, smoking in the restaurant will damage their health and also other people's health. Most people know that smoking is harmful and can lead to many terrible diseases. It is not fair for people not smoke to get diseases because they sit together with smokers in the restaurants. So we must insist it. On the other hand, it will damage the environment. All the people want to eat in a clean restaurant. The unclean environment will make people unhappy and make the bad effect of you in the restaurants. So people will not like the restaurants if there are many smoking inside. Clearly, if we are blind to this problem, it is very likely that the restaurant will receive more and more complaints about smoking. We must pay attention to this problem."
331,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ Above all, I have the belief that there is no doubt that smoking in public places should be forbidden without being tolerated. I have these enough reasons to support this view. First, as everybody knows, smoking is not only harmful to your health but also is harmful to others' health because smoking will make your lung be hurted and even increase the risk of you and the person surrounding with you including to recent surveys. In addition, what makes people unaccepted is that them did't smoke while they have to undertake the bad consequence of smoking through others' doing. So, we can understand that smoking may lead to others' unpleasure while them are talking or walking. You know, the smell of smoking is not always being liked by all the person. For example, if you smoke in a crowd carriage many passengers will be angry at looking at you. On the other hand, no smoking in public places I think is a kind of gentlemen's behaviour because of your knowing to respect the feeling of the public. In the last, if we want to breath fresh air in outdoor, we shouldn't allow smoking in public places. After all, smoking is able to and also should be in the area which is open for smoker especially."
202,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿As is known to us all, college is a place where people look for further education, exchange their academic ideas and finally both enrich their selves for their future career in society and propel the development of all endeavors of society. However, college is not equal to society. College students need opportunities to get in touch with those things beyond campus and accumulate enough practical experiences for their future careers. It is precisely the part-time job that gives such opportunities to college students. Serving in restaurants, working as an intern secretary for a company, or being a salesman selling commodities on short-term sale etc., no matter what part-time job a college student chooses to participate in, she will learn practical skills to adjust to society which academic-centered college cannot teach her. Besides, it should be taken into consideration that part-time jobs do offer a certain amount of money to college students, making some financial income for college students' daily life or even helping them to afford their college study. One of my high school classmates went to a college in Singapore for further education after his graduation, in the first year, his family offered his nearly $15, 000 for study and living expense. Now he is in his senior year, with his part-time job income of nearly $250 per month on average, he will save at least $2, 000 for his family when he get his bachelor degree. During the two years' part-time job, he not only gained money, but also learn things about making contract with a company, getting along with coworker, how a restaurant is arranged and run, etc. Hence, it is important to college students to have a part-time job."
064,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿As a college student, I have to say this is a really good idea. Firstly, most of college students have been an adult in law; they will get into the society after 4 or 7 years. One the one hand, getting a part-time job is a good way to learn more about the real society earlier; on the other hand, they can also add a good experience to their own introduction. Secondly, few students can realize the importance of money and they can not imagine how hard the life is but getting a part—time job can help them. Making a living is not as easy as they think before, so is the life. Having a life should be paid hard working, if you want to have a better life, you even should paid more. Thirdly, during the time they tried to find a part-time job and tried to do it well. Some students may be able to find the target of their lives. The freshmen in college always feel confused. They can't find the things they really want to do; it can be blamed to the Chinese education system. Teachers in primary and middle school never lead students to find their dreams. Under a high pressure, some gifted students may be ignored. On the contrary, the college is a place where students can show their talent. However, after 12-year gave-education, they can not find the correct ways which suit them. All in all, finding a job, and after touching the society, a lot of them will think about the life from a new direction."
065,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, a growing number of college students have part-time jobs. In my perspective, college students have part-time job is necessary. Firstly, college students usually have much free time. So they have opportunities to use that time to do work such as part-time jobs and so on. Then college students have a lot of theoretical knowledge. But they usually are lacking of practicing experience. And having part-time jobs can solve this problem. Secondly, having part-time jobs can let college students make some money. About this money college students can afford a part of their school fee. And they also could buy something they like. Furthermore, it will help them find a job after graduation for college students. Many employers like student mature and have many experiences. Having a part-time job can give you experience and skills. Finally, at present, most of college students are the only child in their families. So it is necessary to let them know the stress about making a living in our society. It is time for college students to know the difficulty of working and making money. So they thank their parents more. In conclusion, as college students, having part-time jobs will bring big revolution for them. I think college students should find a part-time job."
188,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, some university students have a part time job outside the school. However some students don't agree with their behavior. They think this may damage to their course and they may even fail to their examination. They can't balance the course and job. In my opinion, it is important for us to do part time jobs. First of all, it is important for us to have as many useful part time jobs as possible to prepare for career changes after graduated from school. It is very common for us to do a part time job before finding a job that is suitable for us. A student of English language and lecture, for example, may finally settle down in a car company working as a marketing assistant. This results from his or her experience in doing part time jobs. Also, students need to take a wide range of work experience so that we can make ourselves accustom to the job. Our purpose of learning is to find a job. After four years later, every one of us should go to work. In such cases, some experience of job should be highly recommended. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during university is important. This will make you more employable and develop practical shills outside the classroom."

Although smoking is part of someone's life; it should be banned at the restaurant. As known to all, smoking is harm to our health, no matter to smokers or nonsmokers. Smoking has a big health risk. From lots of news or reports we can find that many diseases are caused by smoking. Like, lung cancer, heart trouble and so on. Besides a series of figures have pointed out that the proportion of death of smokers is higher than nonsmokers. What's more, if nonsmokers breathe in the smoke that the smokers breathe out, they will get more serious than smokers. Terrible things are that smoking will damage DNA, which will change family from gene. In addition, there are lots of accident fires causing by smoking. Meanwhile the restaurants are high density of the population. So if the fire causes in a very short time, there are a number people must be died. All in all, restaurant is some place people can enjoy the delicious food and drinking but if someone smoking beside you, it must destroy your mood and harm your health. So smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."
055,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Sitting in front of the table, people hold a great mood to enjoy their meals. What if a great deal of blue smoke from other table enters into their noses? They will feel extremely disgusted by that. So many people protest that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I partly support this demand. On the one hand, smoking not only breaks down people themselves' health, but also hurts other people's bodies. Take one couple for example; a wife breathed too much second-hand smoke while her husband smoked crazily about 20 years every day. After half a year, the wife died from lung cancer. So if a person goes to restaurant every day and then there are a great number of people smoking around him, what will happen to this poor person? Of course, the people who smoked a lot will never free from disease unless he or she is really lucky. But on the other hand, I think reasonable smoking is not so bad for our health only if smokers can control the intensity of smoking. That is a little smoking can relieve people' pressure and make them feel relaxed. Our present lives run up too fast, more and more stress deposits several layers of stones in people's hearts, especially males. So a little smoking can be chosen from people to give off their burdens while being in a restaurant to enjoy meals. Take these two factors into consideration, smoking should be controlled but not completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

Some smokers argue that they have not right to do what they really want to do and they can not stop smoking sometimes in public places. Others say that smoking should certainly banned in public places like restaurants. They have their reasons. In my opinion, I agree with the latter point. Then I will help them to state their reason. First of all, smoking is harmful to smokers' body and people around them will suffer more. Research shows that the second hand smokers suffer 3 times than smokers themselves. So people who don't smoke in the restaurants get affected by the smoke when they sit together with the smokers. Secondly, people always make a bad mood in bad environment. So people around smokers in restaurants will not be in a relax condition and they will not enjoy their meal. What's more, smoke in the restaurants often brings fire accident. We know many incidents happened in restaurants because of smoking. In conclusion, smoking in restaurants should be banned. It seems clear that smoking in restaurants will be bad for smokers themselves and others who don't smoking in restaurants, so these are my reasons."
026,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿I agree the opinion that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I have the following reasons to explain my idea. College students need not only to learn knowledge of books, but also to practice in universities. College students have a part-time job, which are interests. College students can make their knowledge learning from books practiced by home teaching, and they can get the living experience through a part-time job. They can find out their shortcoming and advantages. A part-time job is good for college students' growth. For example, these people's achievements that also experienced the living of a university prove that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college age, they go through the living of a part-time job, and all respects of their abilities are raised. They become more confident of themselves and they have great powers to work. So the reasons above show explain my thought. I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. That is good for the developing of college students. So if you have a chance to have a part-time job, try to get it and work hard. You will get the advantages."
050,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿About this topic, I think that it is not very important for college students to do part-time job. As we know, more college students tend to do a part-time job. Someone even has two or three. Though every coin has two sides, I believe that disadvantages of doing a part-time job outweigh its advantages. Some people guess that doing a part-time job can acquire many benefits, such as income, living experiments, etc. However, it pays us a large quantity of time and energy for the jobs. Doing jobs must be tired; it is not good for our health. In addition, colleges are the place where we learn knowledge. People usually believe that studying is the main task to students but not earning money. I really agree with it. Last but not least, doing part-time job can not earn a large number of money. Nevertheless, it cannot deny that we may be succeeding with lots of income in the future. Thus, knowledge plays an important role in our life. From what has been mentioned above, we can easily come to the conclusion that do part-time job is not a good choice to college students. We should focus more on study now."

But should smoking be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country? My answer to this question is yes. On the one hand, smoking does no good than harm to our health and restaurant is a place of eating. People eat and drink in the restaurant, if one people in the restaurant smoking, it will pollute the whole air of restaurant. Those people around the smokers will not have good mood to have their dinner any longer. Some scientists say that second-hand smoke is more dangerous in many examples. We know people in the restaurants all want to be healthy. On the other hand, smoking in the restaurant may catch the fire easily and it is dangerous for us to have a meal in the dangerous place. I read some news in newspapers that some restaurants got fire because smokers threw cigarettes after smoking into some places in the restaurants. So, because the reasons above, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Let us keep a healthy environment in our eating place."

First, as everyone knows that smoking is harmful for people's health. It not only damages smoker's health, but also let smoker's families to have second- hand smoke. Second-hand smoke is more harmful than smoke. If in the restaurants, of course, smokers will do harm to non-smokers when they smoke in there. So to protect the customers in the restaurants from being polluted, smoking should be banned in the restaurants. Second, restaurants are the places that people enjoy their meal and have a good family time. It is important to build a comfortable and healthy environment for people to eat in there. Many people feel very unhappy when they sit near to some people who smoke. But they cannot protest because smoking is not banned in the restaurants. They have to suffer and bear. Absolutely, smoking should not be allowed. Last, if smoking be banned at the restaurants, the smokers may know that it is annoying to smoke in the public places. They may change their habits to give up smoking. As a conclusion, smoking should be banned at the restaurants."
140,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Smoking at restaurants used to be common and accepted by many people. It is not rare to see men or women light a cigar at restaurants. I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. As is known by all, smoking can lead to many diseases, which is harmful to people's health. Medical science, has proved that smoking can cause lung cancer. Smoker's chance of having a heart attack also increases. Besides, smoking pollutes environment by giving much poisonous gas off into the air. That cause many disadvantages for our environment. What's worse is that smoking affects non-smokers who stay in the same room with smokers more than it does smokers. Passive smokers getting ill are even higher than that of smokers. So, people shouldn't be allowed to have a smoke at all restaurants. Therefore, it is necessary that the government ban smoking at all restaurants, which will benefits people a lot. First, non-smokers are free from passive smoking and its harm. Second, air quality and our environment will be improved if people have less chance smoke at restaurants. Third, through reducing the chance of smoking, it can protect smoker's health. So, there is no doubt that it is of great significance."
327,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿smoking is one of bad habit that I hate most. When a smoker burns a cigarette, he begin to hurt himself. And if there is someone staying around him, he is smoking the second-hand smoke. Especially in public occasion, smoking maybe results in an even serious affection. That situation is always seen in most restaurants. Drinking and smoking seem to the most usual things on the restaurants' tables. However, there is not everyone want to smoking, and someone who cannot stand the smoking maybe in the restaurant. Consequently, I tend to Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. After all, the restaurant is public place. It is difficult to know whether everyone here doesn't mind your smoking here. It should be also considered that if smoking is really completely banned, what affection it can make to the smokers. Actually their smoking on table, in most case, is only a habit, not a necessary thing. Usually, seldom do they go on smoking when they are told not to smoke in the restaurant. So it won't result in much trouble for the smokers. Through the analysis between both sides of the smokers and non-smokers, I agree with the point that Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country."

For me, I cheer on it and I think part-time jobs are beneficial to our college students. And I have three reasons for it. First, having the part-time job is a good way to earn money. The poor college students need the money to support their families. Their parents won't be worried about the money for their children to go to universities. Second, the money can make poor students have more opportunities to do what they are interested in, for instance, they can use it to buy sport equipment like basketball to exercise. The life in college won't be too boring if you are enjoying what you like. Third, having a part-time job is a process to join the society. It is a useful experience for our college students to immigrate knowledge and practice. The more you learn about the society, the easier you can find a job after you graduate. In a whole, it is really important to have part-time jobs for all college students. So I think the colleges should promote it and encourage students to have this experience."
092,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿I can't agree to the view that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. Whether it is reasonable to smoke in the restaurants depends on the real case though smoking is proved to be bad for people's health. And in most of cases smoking in the restaurants is not reasonable. For example, if smoke in elegance restaurants, it may influence people nearby taste their food and harm both sides' health. And it also may leave a bad impression to others and make others angry with you, which may lead a conflict. Smoking in public restaurants is bad for people's health so it should be signed that ""Please stop smoking for you and others"" in the wall of the restaurants. But in some cases if smoking is banned, the restaurants will not be able to operate well. For example, if the customers book a personal room to have a dinner, their behaviors of smoking will not affect others. Though it is bad for their health, it is their choices and they smoke for more enjoyment. The customers will be angry and get away and won't come any more if the restaurant manage doesn't allow them to smoke, which will drop the restaurant's business trades. And in the small restaurant in the countryside, smoking may be not easy to banned because the customer are almost farmers, which don't care much enough the rules. So let them go will make the restaurants operate along. So completely stop people from smoking in all the restaurants in the country is so absolute that it is impossible to reach."
323,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Recently, our teacher have given us a topic about weather university students should do part-time jobs. As a present university student, personally, l think university students should do some part-time job. The reasons are as follows. Firstly, the university students have had the ability to do some part-time job. They have become strong and skilled. They are not children any more. They are adults. Doing a part-time job not only can improve their skills and health condition, let them understand how hard it is to make money, but also can provide them financial support. What's more, a university student really has a lot of time after class. They have many holidays. Why do not they using the time to do some valuable things? Secondly and importantly, the university students doing a part-time job can reduce their parents' financial pressure. Being a university student, they should start to learn to gain more duty. While, doing a part-time job is a suitable chance to practice them. Thirdly, doing a part-time job can really improve their practical skills and experience and can improve their ability to fight pressure. So this can help them to find a good job in the future. Though the university students do a part-time job is good for them, at the same time they should not leave their study alone. This is very important."
210,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ I don't quite agree with this. If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurants in China, customs who like smoking will go to the restaurants less often just because they are not allowed smoking, This will lead to the fact that the restaurants will make less money. It is not good for both the customs and the restaurants, I think. Then smoking is allowed at all the restaurants? The answer is NO. If so maybe it is the turn for the customs who don't smoke not to go to the restaurants less often. So what shall we do? I think the restaurants maybe can set a smoking-room for the smokers. If they want to smoke, they can just go to the smoking-room and enjoy their time smoking. Just as usual as going to the toilet. And the smoking-room costs no money. As is known to all, smoking has a bad effect on our health, but we can't force the people who smoke not to smoke. It depends on themselves but not us. To protect the people who don't smoke, what we can do is to separate them from the smokers. That's my opinion."
282,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿As we all know, smoking is a bad habit that is not only harmful to the smoker's health, but also ruins others' appetite around the smoker. So nowadays smoking in public place such as restaurant, bus, store has become a health concern in society. And some cities like Shanghai has made a rule that forbid smoking in public place. And I think this is a wise measure that government should take. Smoking in public place, I think, is impolite behavior. The people around the smoker may feel uncomfortable because they have to smell the smoke all the time. And in a crowded bus or train, some people even may feel dizzy just because someone is smoking around them. So smoker who smokes in public place do not respect the others around him. Smoking can do harm to our health, not only to the smoker himself, but also to the people around him. Nicotine, which the cigarettes contain, can damage our lungs, and then causes some lung diseases, even lung cancer. Now many researches have found that the smokers are much more likely to get lung cancer than those who do not smoke. And the people who usually stay with smokers may risk having lung diseases. So I think forbidding smoking in public place is necessary. Besides, smoking in public space may also have a bad effect on a city's appearance. If in one city, you see many smokers in the streets, restaurants and parks, you may feel that the air of this city is so dirty and it will make people not willing to stay there. Therefore, a beautiful and comfortable city should forbid smoking in public place. This can not only prevent us from every kind of lung diseases, but also make our life better."

There are billions of people addicted to the cigarette in our country and we could find people smoking everywhere, for instance, in restaurants, train station and even in schools where there are children, the future of our nation, just like smoking has already been a custom of us. As is known to us all, smoking is harmful to both the smoker and all the people staying around, and the second-hand smoking will have more terrible influences. At the same time tobacco cost a lot of our money day after day. Growing could also waste more resource which could be used for grain instead. So for the sake of ourselves, we are supposed to try our best to make more people give up smoking, which will also let us get more advantages. Firstly, the health of us and our family is very important. Secondly we could protect the nature by pouring less harmful gas. Also it's a good manner to refuse smoking and set a good example to the children. Although we has to acknowledge that it is difficult to give up smoking, not smoking in the public places especially where children stay is the bottom."

First of all, most college students are not teenagers but adults, therefore, they shouldn't depend all on their parents. On the other hand, the expenses of studying in colleges are much larger than that of studying in high schools. Don't you think that we should do something to reduce the burden on our parents? Doing part-time jobs is a good way to help us. Then, considering that the experiences of real society will benefit the college students a lot when hunting for jobs, part-time jobs, and part-time jobs is important. By taking a major-related part-time job, students can not only improve their academic studied but gain much experience that they will never get from the textbooks. The students who do part-time jobs have more opportunities to meet people from all walks of life and will be faced up with a wider variety of problems to solve, which will teach the students a lot about the real society. As we all know, the life is the best teacher in our life. At last, some people say that the students may have the enough time to do study and jobs at the same time. In fact, take my experience for example; the college students have a lot of time after the study and many people kill the time by playing computer games. Why don't we spend the time doing some jobs? To conclude, I think that doing part-jobs is very important for college students. There is no doubt that the jobs will bring us many benefits in many ways."

To start with, smoking in restaurants is an impolite behavior. It may affect a lot of people who do not like the smelling. In China, there are many smokers. In this case, if the smoking not be banned, a lot of people in restaurants will smoke. So the smelling will be worse and worse. As for me, I hate those people who smoke in the restaurants. In addition, smoking is bad for people's health, especially for those who do not smoke. The second-hand smoke in the restaurant is badly for people's health. The last but not least, smoking in restaurants will destroy the happy environment when we eating. When we eat in a restaurant, we all want to be in a very good environment rather than a bad environment surrounding the smelling of cigarette. In conclusion, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. I hope it can be put into practice sooner or later."
099,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿I think smoking should be banned as I find it very anti social, bad for people's health and it should be illegal. People can say they have the right to decide how to live their life, even if it means doing something that will disturb others. But we don't let them smoke in the public or other things that would hurt our lives. Let them destroy their bodies in there own home away from non-smokers and ban it from public use completely. Why should we have to be around smokers in the park or get a puff of smoke in their faces when walking behind a smoker? I know these are open air spaces but if you can smell it then it's in the air and you are breathing it in! It's the most annoying thing in the world for a non smoker to be stuck walking down the street behind someone smoking, and can't get past. For that reason I think it should be banned in all public spaces, not just enclosed ones. So I think, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country. It is not only good to the smokers' but also others' health. And, banning smoking can make our public air more clear."

There are two justifications listed below to support my argument. First, we can gain money from the part time job. Students are always lacking of money we can gain money through our hard-working, it will bring a lot of confidence when we get the money we earn. And we can use the money to buy many things we like. It also reduce our family burden. Second, we can gain experience from the part time job. Nowadays more and more company inquire the employee has the work experience and the part time job can give us that. We can familiar with the society in advance. From part time job, we study many knowledge different from text book knowledge in our universities. So the reasons above all show that it is important for college students to have part time jobs. Finally I strongly recommended college student to take a part time job, we can gain benefits from it. If you have free time, try to look for a part time job from now on."
046,PTJ0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿Nowadays, college students want to have a part-time job during their study periods. In my opinion, I think everything has two aspects like one coin has two sides. On the one hand, if you want to gain more experiences in society, to have a part-time job is a good way, but on the other hand, in case you pay more attention on your part-time job that you don't have enough times on your study lessons, for a college student, study is most important for a student. Most college students believe a part-time job can support their more job chances in the future, and it also can improve a person's confidence and responsibility. So in this way, to find a part-time job is a practical idea. There are other college students believe that college is a study place, so they consider that if we spend much time in doing a part-time job, we may delay our school works, in this aspect, concentrating our attention on studying is more important than having a part-time job in society. From now on, college becomes more and more market focus and a college student must be provided with variety of skills. To have a part-time job or not, it all depends on your personal abilities."
289,SMK0,A2_0,CHN,"﻿ There are many people who like smoking, even in the public places they will take a cigarette in hand. Cigarette make them feel comfortable, but to the others around them, it is not comfortable at all. So, I think smoking in public places should be forbidden. Smoking, in my opinion, is totally unhealthy, especially in public places. It will not influence the smoker's own health, but is also bad for the people around. The researches show that, taking the second-hand smoking can damage people's health nearly equal to smoking by oneself. So it is not considerable nor responsible to smoke in public places. At the same time, the smoke coming from a burning cigarette can have bad influence on the environment. Public places belong to all the people, it is impolite and irresponsible to do damage to the public places' environment. The smoke can pollute the air. The burning cigarette can easily cause a fire. So it is better not to smoke in public places. Just think about our environment before lighting up a cigarette. So, from all above, we can see that smoking in public places is a really bad habit. If people no more smoking in public places, the environment will become better and there may be less fire happening. So, I think it is necessary to forbid smoking in public places."
